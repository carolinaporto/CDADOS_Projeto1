"Bangkok to Phuket round trip. The lounge at the airport is available to all passengers, there are snacks, free WiFi and drinks. Check-in was fast and efficient. Inflight meal was very tasty. Cabin staff were as good as always. I will probably fly with Bangkok Airways again.",Promoter
"A real mixed bag with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Shanghai, great flight with bad ground service. The trip got off to a couple of bad starts, I couldn't check in from Queenstown to Geneva since the tickets were not connnected, so I had to drag my luggage between the terminals in Auckland. Then when I tried to check in for Geneva from Auckland they would only check me in to Shanghai since apparently Air NZ can not check people in to transit Shanghai to Air China. This needs to be fixed since I spent 2 hours in queues to get out and back into the airport in Shanghai, I would never fly this route again because of this problem. The terminal walkway in Auckland really needs to be covered since it is frequently raining, it is a bit of a national disgrace that uncovered walkway, not a good way to great arriving tourists. Flying the Dreamliner made this longhaul flight more pleasant, the higher humidity and cabin pressure left me feeling less drained than usual. The entertainment system is excellent with gate to gate service and a good selection of movies. Most importantly the system does not have boxes under the seats making a lot more legroom available. I was lucky to get a sky couch row to myself since the plane was only half full and was able to have the full sky couch to myself for sleeping. Having a full sky couch was great for sleeping, but honestly I can't see how 2 or more people could share one unless they are very short/small people or children.",Passive
"  Second in the queue in business class check-in line, there was an issue with the pax in front of me. He was on his phone trying to sort something, the agent on hers, for 10 minutes - nothing resolved. I later saw this pax in Y on board so don't know if he was only in the line due to OW status. At last, an agent in the Y class line said to her colleague â€œWill I take him?â€ â€“ meaning me â€“ and her colleague replied â€œUp to you.â€ I was being checked in and asked which lounge I used at CDG. â€œDunnoâ€ she said. She asked another agent - â€œI've no idea."" It was so rude / bad I just laughed. I think they thought I couldn't speak French. When I got to the AA lounge (I'd checked before which one to use) the agent said â€œThis is not where you're supposed to be.â€ When I challenged this it was only resolved when a colleague came over to him and explained OW Sapphire rules to him. A sign saying RJ pax could use the lounge was on the desk in front of him. Flight to AMM was OK-ish, but no proactive service from the crew. Meal was served and cleared away as soon as they could manage it â€“ twice, not-finished drinks taken from my table â€“ the crew disappeared behind curtain for the rest of flight. The food was mediocre, the in-flight entertainment limited and uninspiring. The AMM lounge a dump. Poor food, nasty toilets, birds flying inside, no one to let you in shower room. Cannot imagine its state if toilets anything to go by. Security staff at AMM incredibly rude and aggressive. â€œWhere you go?â€ barked, is really not good enough. Flight to BKK full. Most pax in business class appeared to be Royal Jordanian staff, behaving as though on a company outing. As we taxied two were standing in the aisles, using their phones, the woman beside me (no ideas who she was, young and pretty, very popular, both captains came out to chat to her) went into the cockpit for take-off and landing and I did not feel the FAs had proper control of the cabin. Breakfast consisted of 3 types of pastry with a bread roll on the side. No nuts with the welcome drink, no bottle of water, surely the minimum in business class. It was available if you asked for it, but you had to ask. The bar area onboard was used for a flight attendant to store her suitcase. Flights back were more of the same. The flight from BKK only better as only 9 pax in business class. In the middle of the night I pressed the bell to ask for some sparkling water. It took the flight attendant 5 minutes to come and offer to â€œhelpâ€. It's not as if she was busy. I got what I asked for to the letter, a glass with water in it. No ice, no lemon, no offer of anything to go with it. Someone needs to tell Royal Jordanian that training their staff to snarl â€œEnjoyâ€ at English speaking passengers whilst slamming a glass on to the tray and high-tailing it back behind the curtain before any more awkward questions can be asked does not make a premium passenger feel valued. The volume on the passenger announcements on the A321 to CDG was so loud that when the pilot made an announcement mid-flight the dozing man in front of me almost leapt out of his skin. I've learned my lesson. I thought as a One World airline it would be roughly on a par with other carriers in the alliance, if not necessarily as good. The ticket cost about Â£200 less then Qatar Airways and it allowed me to try a new aircraft type for me (the Boeing 787). However I cannot recommend the airline at all. I would sooner not fly than use them again. My main feeling is one of having been cheated out of my money.",Detractor
  London Heathrow to Riyadh return. Pleasant flight on both legs. Boarded and arrived on time and landed earlier than scheduled. This might be down to the low passenger numbers on board the flights due to it being a weekend. Food was enjoyable and served at the right time. Had a seat with extra legroom so this made a huge difference.,Promoter
"  Hong Kong to Bangkok. Check-in at the transfer desk in HKG was efficient and took less than 1 minute. The lounge was busy with plenty of holidaymakers but festive. Did not have to wait for showers. Boarding orderly with priority lanes. The seat was the Boeing 777 pod seat that can turn into a bed. Flight was quite empty and on the last day of the year, cabin crew were chatty and full of holiday spirits. Champagne was offered twice before takeoff and once leveled out, they came with another round of drinks followed by a meal. EntrÃ©e was 3 prawns on a bed of salad, the main dish was Thai curry chicken rice, an option of Chinese fish with rice or an afternoon tea set. There was ice cream for desert. The chief purser went to each passenger towards the end of the flight wishing us a happy new year.",Promoter
HKG-SVO-HKG A330 Economy. Both legs slightly delayed planes reasonably well kept and seats are comfortable with average pitch and recline. Limited choice of movies and TVs on the seat back AVOD IFE. Food was ok. 2 meals but no mid-flight snack for the 10hr flight. Plenty of water runs. Crew pleasant enough.,Passive
"  This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years. The level of service has remained consistent in all areas, with some aspects of service stronger than others. This flight was originally due to depart Bodhgaya at 14.35h arriving in Delhi at 16.25h. An initial delay to a revised 16.00h departure was notified by e-mail several hours in advance. Check-in queue management at Bodhgaya airport was poor but agent service was good once you eventually got to the check-in desk. After further delay at Bodhgaya airport the flight eventually departed shortly after 18.00h and arrived at Delhi at about 20.00h. Not a single delay announcement was made at Bodhgaya airport and the information board simply showed the word 'delay' next to the flight number. We had no idea how long the delay would be until we saw our aircraft land. Except for an expensive coffee kiosk there were no customer facilities while waiting. The flight itself was straightforward and typical of one on Air India's short-haul A320 fleet with friendly, patient, efficient cabin crew and reasonably comfortable seating in a slightly grubby cabin. A simple in-flight snack was served. No announcements from the captain except an abrupt order for cabin crew to take their seats for take off and again for landing. Cabin crew announcements included a sincere apology for the delay. Arrived at Delhi's Terminal 3 where we exited through the international arrivals section because our flight had originated in Yangon, Burma, before picking up passengers in Bodhgaya. This meant that the domestic passengers among us had to join a long slow-moving queue to clear, bizarrely, passport control, where just two desks were dedicated to clearing many domestic passengers, presumably from several flights. It took more than an hour just to get as far as the baggage hall. The lesson is to remember to leave plenty of time if you take a domestic flight with Air India before connecting to an international flight.",Passive
They kept us on an airplane for 2 hours initially hardly any circulation trying to fix a problem with the navigation system. Then they left us on the plane for 2 hours while they tried to fix it giving us false hope every 30 minutes or so. They offered some of us a tiny bag of almonds but we had to share with the person beside us because they didn't have enough for everyone. Finally they got us off the plane 2 hours later. Gave us $10 to buy lunch. Flight was supposed to leave at 10.30am at 1.30pm or so we get an announcement saying flight will be leaving at 3pm. Then another delay to 4pm. Meanwhile the weather outside is getting worse and worse. So now we board at 4pm. They had us sit on the airplane for another 3 hours before we actually took off. 200+ people missed a whole day of vacation time. Updates were very infrequent. To top it all off the flight crew were miserable. They were finally walking by to offer us some food but a) they ran out of everything and b) they walked right by our row without asking. When I waved my hand the attendant got annoyed with me. It was the last time I fly with Air Canada. The free food was a sandwich. The drinks - they gave you pop juice or water and you couldn't have an actual can. Inflight entertainment - forget it. They didn't play a movie on the way to Montego Bay. You had to have the app downloaded on your phone. If you didn't have the app you got nothing.,Detractor
"Kuala Lumpur to Krabi. Despite that AirAsia have the Value Pack consists of baggage allowance and meals for additional price, the website settings require both passengers to take this package and could not be edited to only one of us. It's a short haul flight, full of passengers, but handled well by the ground staff and cabin crew. For those bringing checked-in luggage, use a padlock to avoid any missing items.",Passive
"Frankfurt to Lima via Madrid with Air Europa. Flight from Frankfurt was delayed for 1.5 hours, so the connection in Madrid was very short. For all flights a bus transer was necessary - the direct gangway seems to be to expensive for this airline. I was very disappointed with the cabin crew - especially with small children they were very unfriendly and not cooperative (I myself haven't got kids, but close to me there were a few). The catering reflects the price level of the airline and the same for space and entertainment. They offer only a few movies, but all in 7 languages, and the selection was not too bad.",Passive
Flew JFK to LHR with family of 5 and overall was very satisfied. Transatlantic flights were not full and the whole family had extra room. Only irritating issues were too many announcements which kept everybody awake and seat armrests which do not come up all the way allowing one to stretch out over empty seats. Dublin to London flights were also good. Although we would have preferred direct flights the savings going through Dublin were substantial and well worth the slight inconvenience plus on the way home one goes through Immigration in Ireland which works very well.,Promoter
EWR-SAL-GYE-LIM-BOG-SAL-EWR in the promo fare of Avianca flew 6 times in one week. Although the ticket was very cheap and I did book lowest economy fare as a Gold Member of Star Alliance I was upgraded twice to Business Class. All planes on that trip were brand new EWR-SAL an Airbus A320. Seats in Economy were comfortable in Business there were relaxing recliners with a footrest. The individual inflight entertainment has a huge selection of great Movies and TV shows in Spanish English and Portuguese. Food in both cabins is good and fresh. Service is excellent. Friendly and helpful crews. The Airports I did visit are world class and lounges for Business and Gold members offer free drinks and food. The brand new Bogota Avianca lounge is impressive.,Promoter
" Tashkent to Istanbul. A poor experience with Turkish Airlines. The guy who seemed to be the cabin chief was acting in a very extremely rude way towards the passengers, almost yelling at them, mostly hurrying people to sit down quickly. Very unprofessional. The tightest space for seating I experienced, apart from a low cost carrier in Indonesia. A mess with luggage, clearly too many volumes allowed onboard.",Detractor
"The boarding was as slow as usual. Everything else was fine except for the snack. This consisted of a tasty wrap - raw falafel in a half raw pancake. It tasted horrible. Upon examining the list of ingredients I discovered it contained, anong other things, milk, no good for the lactose intolerant. The spring water came from Turkey!

" Flew New York JFK to Mendoza via Santiago with LATAM. Very expensive airline with zero customer service. Never book this airline through a travel agent of any kind. I paid over $4,000 for a ticket to Santiago 6 months in advance and when I tried to add a flight to Mendoza less than 1 week later, LATAM told me that I can't do that until 2 days before the flight because I booked through Expedia. I was perfectly willing to pay a change penalty. They still wouldn't allow me to add a flight! I have never encountered this problem with any other airline.",Detractor
Our experience has been a nightmare with this airline today. After flying from Vienna to Chicago we were re- routed to Detroit due to bad weather. Waited on plane additional 2 hrs finally told flight cancelled and we would be disembarking and new flight arrangements would be made after checking in at Austrian Airlines. Instead no Austrian Airlines personnel could 'ticket' us no option to assist in flights home from Detroit no assistance at all. We were dumped in Detroit and loaded on to buses driving 6 hrs back to Chicago airport. When we arrived there was no Austrian Airlines personnel to assist us. Fortunately the wonderful accommodating United Airlines staff were helpful in obtaining flights home. Their employees stayed into the early morning hrs to help us. We will never recommend this airline.,Detractor
" First time flying Business Class on the A350-900. Same herring bone layout as the B777, which I think is the best layout as all the seats have aisle access and means you're not having to step over people to get out of your seat. The seat in design terms is pretty much the same as the old product, which is a great, why change something if it ain't broke, but obviously with a better resolution screen, updated handset, and a couple more storage holes. However, my only gripe about the A350 is that the headphone sockets now only takes a 2 pin adaptor of which strangely one is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm. Hence my Bose QC35 no longer work - first world problems right? Cathay or Airbus please work with Bose to sort this out! I noted on this flight that the crew did not give out the full evening meal i.e. missed out dessert and cheese board. Plus the crew weren't as attentive or proactive as expected from Cathay which was a first for me as I normally praise Cathay staff.",Promoter

"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. As evidenced by the last 3 of 4 international departures with Thai Airways from Bangkok, they seem to more frequently be parking their aircraft at a remote location and then busing passengers which is a headache and not a comfortable start to the trip. The aircraft was old and worn with IFE of poor quality. The inflight meal this time was quite bland and poorly presented. With the flight half full, a little more effort could have been put into attentive inflight service.",Passive
" Bangkok to Sapporo was the good flight. The cabin crews are very helpful and nice. Thai airways always give you a welcome service on board, so polite and always smile. Foods was fine, warm and tasty. However, the aircraft is quite old. I search for the information about that aircraft and found that its age is around 20 year. However, there is no tear on the seats but you would find some stains on the seat. the leg room and seat width are standard for economy class. The entertainment display is a bit small and low-resolution display because it is an old aircraft. Everything is good. Strength : warm service, nice and helpful crews. Weak : pricey ticket fare, old aircraft",Passive
 The worst experience of traveling ever: They canceled my flight on the same day of departure I had to buy a very expensive last minute ticket with another airline because the very unresponsive customer service told me the next Norwegian flight available would have been leaving in 15 days! They didn't compensate for my monetary loss. On the return flight the ruined my luggage and they wouldn't compensate. On an 11 hrs flight from Paris to Los Angeles they don't even offer water to people that don't buy their very expensive and unappetizing lunch Avoid this airlin .,Detractor

21/12/13 LHR-DOH-BKK 5/01/14 BKK-DOH-LHR. What did I think of the service? In a word impressive!

The airline service is okay generally, but not for a team out for a robotics competition: we were in Houston for a robotics competition and checked our robot before the flight.

"  Semi-frequent flyer of Cathay Pacific, so not surprised service was as on par as usual. Red-eye flight between Hong Kong and New York Kennedy with a stopover in Vancouver. Transit passengers from HKG boarded prior to passengers departing from YVR through a gate with partition in between. Boarding for YVR-originating passengers was a bit hectic, and gate agents were running around trying to get priority boarding completed before general boarding began. I was granted priority boarding, thanks to the benefits of their frequent flyer program. I was greeted with enthusiasm and warmth by the purser, a great way to start a trip. Business Class was very empty, Premium Economy was almost full, and Economy was 80% full (a lot of the middle seats were empty). Personally, I felt like the crew were able to provide a more comfortable service, as there was no hassle to get through the meal service. Choice of food were either rice with chicken in a black bean sauce, or braised beef with mashed potatoes. I went with the rice option, and needless to say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had on CX. Flight departed YVR and landed in JFK ahead of schedule. My bags were the first ones dispense, so I was able to get out of the airport fairly quickly. I can't wait to fly with them again in July.",Promoter
Flew from Vienna to Tel Aviv round trip in business class on older Airbus. Not worth the fare for business class. Business class simply means the first few rows in the plane with same seating as economy but no one in the middle seat. Food was good and service was pleasant enough but seats reclined only slightly were not particularly comfortable and in any event identical to economy. I guess if you don't want anyone sitting next to you place a high priority on sitting in the front of the plane and are willing to pay a lot for this then enjoy.,Promoter
"  Alitalia exceeded my expectations for my flight to Miami from Rome. The flight attendants were professional, on time to refill glasses with beverages and offer any additional help. We had a mess-up with the seats during the check-in, and would have ended up seating separately, however the flight attendants managed to rearrange the seats and put us together. It is worth noting that almost every couple in business class had a mess-up with the seats, therefore, kudos to the crew for their effort to rearrange the seating. We were presented with a Bvlgari flight kit. The business class cabin is very stylish, seats recline to a flat bed, and extremely comfortable. A330-200 only 6 years old and the cabin felt fresh and not beaten up. Bathrooms were nice. TV Screens are big and the menu easy to navigate. The food and beverage service was impressive. We were served amazing restaurant quality fish and beef with wonderful tomato pasta with basil, accompanied by Italian wines and other spirits. Also an assortment of Italian cheeses and desserts, cappuccino and chocolates. The rest of the flight we managed to get 4-5 hours of sleep. We were served snacks prior to our descent to Miami. During the snack my wife's entertainment system froze. The flight attendant tried to revive it, but the screen would not turn back on. About 40 minutes later, the same flight attendant approached us with deep apologies and gave a voucher for 150 euros credit towards the purchase of a future ticket with Alitalia.",Promoter

Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home.,Detractor
"Scheduled flight to leave on Sunday August 16, 2015 from Sea/Tac at 1:31pm. The plane that we were going to use pulled up to pick us up. Then some ""newly hired flight attendant"" activates the slide - see the photo. Evidently once the slide has been deployed out the side of the plane, you can't just poke it back in and fly away. Also, who would have guessed that there isn't a backup plane available. So now we have to wait until 8pm for another plane to fly from Dallas to pick us up. Does it take 6 hours to fly from Dallas to Seattle? I think not. We are notified that we will miss all our connecting flights. The next seats available to Des Moines aren't until Tuesday or Wednesday. Well that isn't going too well with our employers, so we negotiate through a supervisor with ""finance"" to get reimbursement should we fly to another city and take ground transport home. BTW, we were offered snacks for sale and a movie headphone for sale while we were on our flight with 200 passengers that also sat at the airport all day waiting for this flight. Absolutely rude.

In Beijing we wanted to secure some emergency exit seats on the flight to FRA: to do so we had to go back landside, speak at 3 different counters, paying 80 EUR, which is an acceptable amount, but we did it. The aircraft was a quite old A330, although it was quite well kept. The seats were not very comfortable, and I needed to stand up quite often. The staff was polite, even though not very much smiling. Food decent, but not fantastic. The IFE was quite old, and didn't have a great choice: also, mine gave up after a couple of hours, and couldn't be used any longer. Overall, it was a correct flight, but in future, I would rather fly Lufthansa instead. Although this flight had LH codeshare, I had a ridicoulous amount of M&M miles (1641), and the segment is not valid on status level counting.",Passive

" Salt Lake City to Denver. This was my first and last experience with this airline. If you are smart (which I was not-- I booked thinking it would be fine for such a short flight), don't fly this airline. Nothing was good about this airline. You get what you pay for and in this case you think you are getting a good deal, but in the end with all their charges you are not getting a good deal. The website did not work--booking for the wrong date and trying to get you to book more expensive seats when I picked a cheaper one. I finally had to leave the website and book on another website. I actually wonder if the website purposely books the wrong day so you will have to pay more money. They charge for everything, even a back pack to carry on! There was not even an agent at the gate and people were just standing there waiting to check in (8:30am). The agents at the airport were rude although the reservation agents on the phone were more professional. I never complain about poor service, but this was such a bad experience, I wanted others to know what to expect. I am sure they will not change or improve their practices as a result of this review--they are not classy enough to do that. I just want warn others before they waste money! As others have said in these reviews (I wish I had read them), fly with a real airline. There motto is something like ""Economy airline done right"" - that is a huge joke. It is an example of just the opposite.",Detractor

"  Mumbai to Delhi on Air India. I had taken this afternoon flight on an Airbus A321 after checking in online prior to the flight. Had dropped off my baggage at the designated drop off point and proceeded towards the boarding gate. The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served.

"  Stockholm to Reykjavik via Toronto. I ordered a meal from the in-flight menu. It was a margarita pizza and cost CAD $12.37. The flight attendant said it would take 15 mins. One hour later after inquiring about it he replied that he had forgotten. He later returned with a small burnt pizza that was so hardened, the plastic fork broke when I tried cutting into it. He said to try it and if it tasted bad that he would replace it. It was served on the plastic wrapper which had burnt cheese and melted to the pizza, upon a piece of paper towel. It was disgusting looking and tasted mediocre. Did u eat it? Yes, I was starving! The plastic and paper towel garbabge remained with me the remainder fb the flight as no flight attendant ever came by to collect the waste. I will not be flying WOW ever again.",Detractor

I must say that with the cheap tickets you get what you pay for. Not only did they give my husband and I the run around, they denied us entry onto the flight and tried to sell us tickets for 5x the original price. Arbitrary fees, and terrible customer service. This cheap trip ended up being one of my most expensive and least pleasant (complete with tears from the rude treatment I received). Not only was the customer service awful, when I did complain the staff waited an entire month to return my email and when they did they simply said that it wasn't their fault and that they closed the case.

I noticed that they had change the airplane from E-190 to A320, and they have also changed the destination to London Heathrow. I understand that airlines have to cancel flights sometimes due to various reasons but it is unacceptable to do it without noticing passengers affected (and they put me on an earlier flight so I could have missed it). To be honest the onboard service was acceptable, the plane was spotless (but pitch was very tight and again very hard seats). The lack of communication is a let down and I will avoid using TAP.

I booked 2 tickets from Montreal to Las Vegas in business class and paid more than $ 5000. I was seated in the first row and have never had so little leg room in any airline including economy class. I moved to a back seat during the flight and I had more room than where I was seated. No place to put my jacket no place to .ut my carry on as first four bins were full with Air Canada equipment. No entertainment screen. They give you an Ipad so you can watch 15 year old movies. No place under my seat to store my computer. The flght attendant took it away during takeoff and landing and I had to ask to get it back after take off. The tray in the first row is very small and no place to put a glass. A passenger to my right spilled his coffee twice. Very inexperienced staff. She spilled water on me and no excuses. He would serve men before women. My travelling companion received a wet towel but not me or at least 5 other travelers in business class. The toilets at the front were available to everyone on the plane. I asked to hang my jacket and they told me that they do not have any room and to put in on the middle seat. When you book a seat in business class you expect quality and comfort. The way I see it I ended up paying $ 3000 for our two meals.,Detractor

 San Francisco to Phoenix. I wish I could give this airline negative stars! I used to travel all of the time using any of the major airlines. I have gone through a lot in the last 5 years. Travel has been very scarce. I booked a 2 week trip overseas. My mistake was to let the touring company book the air for me and my second mistake was letting them choose United. They gave only a 45 minute wait between my 2nd and 3rd flight and the plane left over an hour late. Strike 1. My final flight of the day was with Lufthansa. Fortunately Lufthansa got me on another flight but I had to wait 7 hours in an airport. Thank you Lufthansa. Strike 2 United. Coming home from my trip the touring company booked me a 5 hour layover in San Francisco. I already had 24 hours of real traveling time scheduled. After 3 different gate changes in San Francisco they finally said they were having plane maintenance issues. An 8:00 pm flight has now been moved to 10:20 pm at yet another gate.

At the time of check in, no Information from the staff was given. Most officials who are appointed at counters in Innsbruck appear completely disinterested and show no motivation.

At the time of boarding, no Information about connections in Frankfurt could be provided. When this was mentioned in the aircraft to purser, she suggested to contact ground staff. 30 minutes after boarding, the flight was cancelled and passengers returned to the main hall.

Detroit to Amsterdam flight was a newly refitted Boeing 767-400 with nice business class beds but the monitor screen was small and could not compare with competing airlines. I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta. Breakfast was a cereal which was OK. IFE selection was better than average on the international sector. Both sectors had a very good WIFI connection.",Passive

" Found cheap flights to Iceland and booked on WOW air, mainly because they were the only airline offering non-stop flights. Then, I read all the mostly-negatives reviews. I decided that I knew what I was in for (no entertainment, no free meals or drinks, etc.) and decided the reviewers were probably just hard-to-please. I paid for the checked bag and carry-on. Turns out, we didn't need carry-ons, so that was a waste of money. Also paid for ""priority boarding"". Found out that meant you get to board a bus first that takes you half way across the airport to get on the plane. Not so bad in L.A., but when landing in Iceland at 4.00 am, in cold and blowing snow, one really doesn't want to wait at the top of a flight of stairs while a second bus is brought up to carry passengers to the terminal. And, it's annoying to see empty gates at which the ""real airlines"" get to park. Obviously, one of the ways WOW saves money is by not paying to use those jetways. The bus trips are a true annoyance. Flights not so bad (paid for a ""comfy"" seat in front, a must!) as long as you bring a sandwich and water. Flight crews not especially helpful or friendly. Found out that it's much cheaper to buy the food on board (which didn't look bad) rather than buy food in Iceland. $45 for 2 cheeseburgers in the terminal opposed to $11 for a meal on board. All in all, not a terrible experience, and it beat 5-24 hour lay-overs on other airlines.",Passive

You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew's attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there's less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period.",Promoter
"London to Vancouver. Why there is zone boarding no one really knows nor understands as every traveller is confused about when to board. Zoning hampers boarding greatly as it does not consider row numbers only the ticket price as common denominator. Zone 5 by far what most people have is the last, but since row numbers are all over the place there is a long line-up throughout the plane, since row 19 or 40 are boarding at the same time. Food on Air Canada flights is tasteless. Flight attendants on this flight were not helpful when asked for things such as special meals.

"Flying out of Las Vegas is often a depressing experience. The airport can be full gamblers who lost, or people sad to see their vacations end. The security line and line for the ticket counters can be infinite. On my flight, there was a gate change about 20 minutes before our flight was to board. This wasn't announced until shortly after we were supposed to board. There was some additional delay in boarding and our flight left about 30 minutes late. On Southwest, there are no assigned seats. I elected for $12 for the advanced check in option, and was assigned slot B5 (which is equivalent to the 65th person to board the aircraft). I had no problem finding a seat I liked, window seat near the front of the plane. There was wifi with about 20 live TV channels available on your own device. One thing I like about Southwest is they do not take themselves that seriously. Humor and a laid back attitude is common among ground staff and flight crew. The crew on my flight were attentive and friendly. Southwest also does not charge a bag or change fee. I booked the lowest fare and my fare went down a few times. I was simply able to change my flight to the current fare and a credit is now in my account to use towards future flights. I do not get my money back per say, but I do not lose it either.

"Flight from Boston to O'Hare, fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

" Some days ago I made 2 bookings for a trip from Athens to Dublin and later on (the same day) I realised I needed to change the flight dates (and so I did) and proceeded to do it in the 24 hour grace period that Ryanair proclaims that it provides for this kind of changes. However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?). Never trust Ryanair for anything. They prove to be one of the worst scammer airline companies there is.",Detractor
"  My daughter and I flew to Heathrow from Lexington and our first flight via Chicago went well. Plane departed and arrived on time. Unfortunately, the next leg of the trip wasn't as good. We sat in the plane in the heat for over an our before the plane departed. Once we were in the air, I took off my shoes and unfortunately slipped on the plastic runner under my seat and broke my toe on the seat in front of me. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who said I could have a wheelchair waiting for me at the gate in Heathrow - I declined as I felt I needed to at least try to walk, this was the beginning of my vacation with my daughter. The next thing that happened was that my special food order (gluten free) wasn't available. They said they never got the order although I had specially made the order on-line before my flight. I had to make do with another meal and the same with breakfast. The exact same thing happened on my return flight to the U.S. even though I'd made sure the order was done on-line once again. On the return flight, the flight attendant went to first class to get me some fruit and cheese. The plane was so old and tattered (both ways), the bathroom had ashtrays inside. The entertainment was non-existent with a tiny screen on the seat in from about the size of two decks of cards. All of the movies started at the same time so we were unable to choose anything that hadn't already started. Even if I'd been able to choose something, it would have been impossible to hear as the plane was so loud that my ears were buzzing long after the flight. Everything was old and tattered. What has made me even more irritated is that I received an email asking me to rate my journey (both ways). I mentioned these things and haven't heard a word from United.

"  London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda return via Beijing. It was cheap and I needed to book asap. Take off from LHR was on time, surprising as they have a penchant for being late. Air hostesses were pleasant enough to communicate with - food was standard Western and Chinese option (they made a notification that they don't have enough western options so it may run out) - this seems to be standard practice with them. I was fed and watered so that was fine. Seats are a little narrow but that is expected on a Boeing 777-300ER, however it wasn't unbearable. Entertainment was lacking in western options but you're on a Chinese airline, when in doubt just sleep (if you can). Passengers can be annoying with some of their habits but it didn't affect me much.

You had to ask for water to the sullen stewardess at the back of the plane. It was a 6 hour flight. The flight today was from Bogota to Cartegena. Avianca has a dedicated terminal which was very busy but efficient. All 3 flights left between 20-30 minutes later than scheduled. The staff decidedly looked away when you were boarding probably anxious that you may ask a question. Other passengers were on my allocated seat on two flights and I had to engage with them whilst staff looked away. Perhaps it's the local way. The plus was new Airbus jets 320 and 319.,Detractor
"  London to Bangkok via Bahrain. Checking at LHR was quick and painless. The Falcon Gold lounge at LHR is really good and worth a visit although it can be crowded when there is a full business class. Boarding was quick and gate staff ensured that business class and families with small children could board first. The cabin crew gave a warm greeting at the door and pointed us to our seat where bottled water and aminty kits were waiting. Welcome drinks were served and the onboard chef came round to take meal orders. The seat is very comfortable and much better than say BA's but it has been a few years since GF introduced their current cabin and it is starting to show it age so while everything works the cabin is screaming for a refurbishment. The crew were a delight on this trip. We hit a spot of medium turbulence and a lady were struggling to cope but the cabin crew took turns to sit with her and reassure her for the 15 minutes or so the turbulence lasted. The food was delicius, possibly some of the best in the air and it can easily compete with Turkish and Qatar. The IFE is fairly simple and along with the cabin could benefit from attention. The stop over in BAH was made comfortable by the Falcon Gold lounge which provides great food and drink and showers if needed. The second leg to BKK was as comfortable as the first with great food and a delightful cabin crew. Again everything worked but the cabin was showing its age. That should not, however, take away the fact that GF is offering a solid business class product with one of the widest business class seats I know of making it possible to sleep comfortably. Bedding composes of a thick blanket and a pillow but there is no seat cover or turn down service provided. Unfortunately they do also not provide slippers. Both flights were on time and at BKK priority cards for immigration were handed out on disembarcation and bags were quickly delivered in the arrivals halls.",Promoter
" Istanbul to Izmir. I am not happy at all with the customer service received, I complaint and they didnÂ´t give me any satisfying solution, several texts were sent and calls were made, neither give me correct information in the airport when I ask for my damage in the suitcase (a wheel out and a whole). At the end they decided that 20 USD refund was enough for all the irregularities and for not arising out of this damage against the airline, employees, director, subcontracters and agents, they should head drop in shame, they told me to sign a letter. I had to carry a three wheel suitcase and buy another one in my holidays, besides plenty of time wasted.",Detractor
"Weird timing for this Asiana Airlines flight from Seoul to Honolulu as it leaves at 8pm and arrives about 11 hours earlier the same day. So has a short night when flying over the international date line. Ground staff were good and queues short at ICN. Business class lounge was okay, food choices limited but a comfortable and quiet space. Departure and arrival were on time, the flight had an angled seat which is not ideal for a premium seat on an 8 hour route. IFE was limited, some cheesy vintage music selections The let down was the food, I chose the western option and it was all excessively sweetened, even savoury dishes. Crew was impeccable throughout, really excellent and a credit to the airline.",Passive
" Frankfurt to Buenos Aires return via Madrid. All flights were fine without any problems. Departure of first flight (FRA-MAD) was delayed by 20 minutes. While we were waiting at the gate, the captain went through the cabin and asked passengers if they had any questions. A great gesture, never seen this before. I was worried about my connection, but finally the flight arrived on time in Madrid. Had to change terminals (4 to 4S) and go through passport control, which took 35 minutes. By the way Madrid is a great airport, clean, great architecture and easy connections. Flight to Buenos Aires was very relaxed. Seat was spacious and comfortable, good IFE and nice crew. I liked the Airbus A340-600 because of its 2-4-2 seat configuration. First meal was very delicious, second meal was a snack box, which was okay. There were snacks and drinks available at the galley, but FA's could have done more drink rounds between meals. Same experience on the return flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Had a long layover at Madrid (5 hours) and decided to spend 30 Euros for the airport lounge including showers, free drinks and food, which was a good investment before my last flight to Frankfurt. All in all it was a good experience with Iberia.",Passive
AI331 25 April BKK-BOM A321 Seat:9F (Exit Window). Check-in was Smooth and efficient agents in BKK had smiles on their faces. Boarding was decent and organised. Seat with obviously great legroom (Exit window). Inflight entertainment crashed in the first 15 minutes of being airborne. I ordered a VOML (Vegetarian Oriental meal) less than 6 hrs prior to departure but my surprise it was offered to me on the plane. I must commend the Crew who make a huge effort to satisfy passengers on the plane since most of them are first time flyers and seeing Drinks/Food being free they want to extract the most they can. Loved the good sleep. Warning - Seat row * has a layout of 2x2 against the standard of 3x3 these seats do not recline at all (Staff at the check-in warn you of this as well which is great).,Promoter
We recently travelled business class return to Auckland via Singapore. We used both the 777 and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed an excellent choice of food and wines and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines but they are well worth the money.

"  London to Abidjan via Lisbon. TAP Portugal is the worst airline I have taken. For both my flights TAP did not leave on time. We were delayed for an hour and 15 minutes to my destination and nearly an hours delay on my way back. What did this mean for my transfer flight? Delayed baggage. When you are travelling for business purposes, meant to be presenting the next day and have no luggage with you, it does not bode well. To make matters worse, the bag was not delivered to me, I had to go and pick it up at the local airport at 10pm, 2 days after. This is after spending 3 hours (9:45pm-12:45am), trying to sort out where my bag had ended up, because the ticket attendant who checked in my bag did not put the baggage number on my ticket. Cue in running around a foreign airport, trying to find TAP staff who were still working past 11 at night, in order to obtain the baggage number and then take that to the delayed / lost baggage office. I therefore knew, with the return flight being an hour late, that I would have the same problem. After waiting 25 minutes by the baggage carousel, I filed a delayed/lost baggage claim. The man at the GBS counter tried to tell me that there were no messages on his system and therefore I should wait it out. I politely but firmly had to tell the guy that this same thing had occurred before and I am not prepared to wait 3 hours (again) in an airport. Having filed the report, I received an email acknowledging the delayed bag. 12 hours later a second email came through, informing me that my bag had been located and will be put on the plane the next morning. So it never left from its transfer location once again. In addition, an airline which does not provide in-flight entertainment for flights longer than 4 hours, needs a serious review. Needless to say, I will not be using TAP again. The only positive about this airline is the staff on the ground - extremely nice and helpful.",Detractor
"A bright cheerful welcome into a rather old cabin. I was hoping for the excellent food I'd enjoyed on Austrian Airlines, but it was not to be. There was the same felt amenities kit, the Swiss one makes an excellent I-Pad cover. The very old entertainment system broke and could not be made to work, so we were all given 8000 Km or 200 Swiss Francs voucher for other flights - both useless to me as I'm not going to Europe again for several years. The cabin was very hot. There's no nice undersheet to go over the seat when you go to sleep. Business Cabin is quite crowded - the only good aspect was, everyone behaved and was quiet. One is always at the mercy of other passengers in the confined space of a cabin. Some of the crew were delightful. All women of varying ages. At least we were on time, leaving and arriving. But felt sick from being overheated for 12 hours.",Detractor

" Hong Kong to Brisbane. Amazing interiors, smooth flight. However, bad attitude of cabin staff. Service is disgusting, more like clock watchers and robots.

The only thing they were willing to do was fly us home 4 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. The didn't offer any compensation for what we spend driving home.

Bangkok to Hong Kong on a brand new A350. Though the seat itself wasn't different from the ones on the Boeing 777-300ERs, the refreshed IFE, alongside with the retouches of the storage space made the hard product a solid one. The flight attendants were professional. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 9-year old 777-300ER. I would say the thing that stood out to me most on this flight was the cabin crew, who were proactive. Catering was a big improvement from my previous trip, with meals served in appropriate portions and tasted amazing! Both flights departed and arrived punctually. Bags were quick to arrive and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of arriving, which is rare when flying into Vancouver.",Promoter
AMS-BON (Bonaire). Very pleasantly surprised. First time with KLM and I did not expect much of the KLM economy product but it was an excellent flight. Fairly recent A330-300.

"Recently flew Bogota-Paris-Amsterdam-Paris-Bogota. The long-haul BOG-CDG was terrible. The A-340-300 was not as tidy as one could expect and IFE was deplorable.

Fortunately ground staff at CDG were polite and booked me another flight later that day and provided me a 20-euro meal voucher. CDG-AMS was nothing special FAs were quick and not-so-kind at serving snacks and beverages. My return flight was in Premium Economy and things really improved here. FAs were extremely kind and smiling. However I waited more than 40 minutes for my bag even though I had a priority sticker. Conclusion of this review: Don't fly Air France if your travelling Economy.

For Economy Cathay does a very good job. The food is horrible but at least they serve you which is more than I can say for the other carriers. Good attentive service and full entertainment.

"  This was my first time travelling with Thai Airways flying Incheon to Melbourne. All flights were on-time or nearly on-time and the cabin service on all sectors was of a high standard, but there is room for improvement in other areas. The cabin interiors seemed a little bit tired and worn out, especially on the 777, with the seat upholster being damaged and screens out of date and not working properly. I ordered a gluten-free (GF) meal but regretted the choice, as they seemed to have also removed almost everything else from the meal in the process, only giving me a bland piece of chicken with tasteless steamed vegetables. The normal meal looked much nicer and was incidentally GF anyway (rice and Thai curry). I cancelled the GF meal for the return journey and just substituted their bread with my own GF bread. It also seems a little strange and annoying that Thailand's flag carrier does not have adequate gate access at Bangkok airport, and so all of the flights involved bussing to and from the planes, which were parked very far away. Upon arrival in Melbourne I noticed that my bag had been opened and the zips broken. I lodged a complaint at the Melbourne luggage desk and after following it up just once, they ended up sending me a brand new suitcase in time for my return journey. I was quite satisfied with this response to my complaint. Even though I had a dis-functional screen on one sector, I was mostly satisfied with the entertainment overall system. The only other issue was the seat comfort. I really think this could be improved, as there was an entertainment system processing box under the seat of the 777 and the seats on the A330 felt like I was always sliding off them. Overall it was a decent product for the price, but they could especially improve on seat and cabin quality.",Promoter

"  Berlin to Brussels. My family and I had a connecting flight from Berlin to Stuttgart, Germany. Our original flight got delayed an hour so we had to be moved us to an earlier flight to make our connecting one. Once we got to Brussels we couldn't find our bags, we went to customer service and Eurowings had left a note saying â€œyou're luggage is still in Berlin. Sorry for the troubleâ€. At this point we were very mad because our medicine and toiletries were in our luggage. The next day we had to buy new clothes. They said they would send it to our Airbnb in Paris for when we get there but our train didn't get in until 9 so it was arranged that they would wait til 9:30. As my mom was on the phone with them saying that we weren't gonna be there til 9:30 the guy yelled at her and said â€œYou were supposed to be here at 9. Get here or I'm leaving!â€ After that they got disconnected, and when my mom tried to call back they wouldn't answer her calls. So obviously we ran to the Airbnb to get here at around 9:15-9:20 to see that he had left. They haven't given any info to when they will supposedly bring our luggage to us, but we're furious because we aren't being compensated even though we have to buy new things again tomorrow.

"Qantas doesn't fly out of Beijing so they codeshare with China Eastern Airlines. There was a fast business class check in at the airport but when we asked for the lounge we were told there was none, but we could sit in a few comfortable chairs in an airless alcove. And no, they couldn't give us a bottle of water. We were cooler waiting in the public areas. There was no priority boarding, no priority disembarkation at the stopover in Nanking but it did have a business class lounge with comfortable seats, drinks and unappetising food. The meal selected from the menu couldn't be provided even though business class was only two-thirds full and the standard of English comprehension wasn't good even thought the flight attendants were attentive. We received a priority card on landing which expedited our way through to the baggage claim where our baggage came off last and damaged. The handling was so rough an item packed in moulded styrene to fit its shape was broken in the suitcase which was also split and scratched. So if flying out of Beijing, don't go China Eastern Airlines just to collect Qantas partner points. It's not worth it! Oh, and my entertainment system didn't work either!",Detractor

MAD-MIA on a new A330. IB has a very frustrating problem with pre-reserved seats. I like an aisle to the point where I am willing to pay extra for it. However I discovered that simply wasn't possible in this case. I was booked on the AA codeshare flight (IB6123) and was unable to display my reservation on the IB website until the day before departure. 24 hours prior to departure I did online check in when my booking mysteriously appeared. The system printed out a PDF file with no seat allocation and told me to check at the airport so I called IB. They too were unable to display my reservation and told me that as I had gone into online check in they would be unable to change my seat allocation anyway. The fact that I did not have a seat allocation appeared not to matter. I later went back to the website and tried recheck in and this time the system printed out a proper boarding pass and yes an aisle seat. At no point in the process did I get a choice. This is a great shame because I found check in staff gate staff and the flight crew all very professional and friendly. The A330 is an excellent product and the meal and drinks service was perfectly adequate and followed by an afternoon snack box prior to arrival in Miami. The entertainment system is very good with a good selection of movies on demand. I did find that some of the movies offered were not loaded in the system and were therefore unavailable. We left 15 minutes late and arrived on-time so this was a good flight. If IB resolved the seat allocation issue it would be a greatly improved airline.,Passive

"  Tried Emirates for the first time from London to Melbourne via Dubai, UK having previously travelled Singapore Airlines. The difference could not be more stark. My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end. I may have been spoilt by Singapore Airlines and it may have been a one off bad experience, but serious improvement necessary.",Detractor

SYD-DXB-DUB. DUB-DXB. I have mixed feelings about Emirates. I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build.

"  Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset. The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad. For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food. These were sale flights I booked and I don't know whether I would fly them again.",Passive
London to Brindisi via Milan out and via Rome back. Haven't flown Alitalia for several years and was shocked at the complete absence of catering services. On all 4 flights there was a very poor selection of drinks (soft drinks only) and absolutely no food whatsoever apart from a tiny packet of savoury snacks - and this even on the Rome to London sector with a scheduled flight time of 2 hours 45 minutes. At least on budget airlines you can buy food - but on Alitalia there is nothing. Plus points are the cabin decor which is attractive and clean and the seats which are comfortable with good legroom.

I am a small person, 5"", 110 lbs. We flew from Denver to DC January 2016, 2.5 hour flight. I sat on my jacket the whole way for some cushion. I recommend bringing a seat cushion, like you would if you were sitting on bench for a game. There is no plugins for devices, coffee is $2 - really? You pay for everything. Pack your own water and your own healthy food, because all they have is junk food to purchase. Leg room, unless you pay extra, is non- existent. They charge for checked and carry-on luggage. By the time you add everything you need to a basic ticket you are paying more than most other airlines. They also make you buy a subscription to get the lowest basic prices. I always flew Frontier in the past, not anymore. Southwest is looking really good to me. Finally, getting the luggage out in a timely manner has somehow escaped them in all these changes, too few staff?

My husband and I were on the flight from Madrid to New York on 15th April. We were supposed to land at 2.30pm and it was about 8.30pm when we finally landed. The pilot kept trying to land at JFK and could not because of the weather. We had to go to Boston and refuel then go back to New York to land. I want to commend the pilot and all the crew on the flight. They handled everything very professionally. The pilot kept everyone apprised of what was happening and even came out and spoke to everyone in English and Spanish when we were on the ground in Boston. When we landed we had to talk to the staff at the Iberia Air counter to figure out how to get home. There were many people in the same situation as us so we had to wait quite a while. Given a hotel for the night given meal vouchers told us where to catch a shuttle to the hotel and arranged flights for the next afternoon. What was a really bad situation was made a lot more tolerable because of the crew on the plane and the staff at the counter at the airline terminal. I would and will certainly recommend Iberia.,Promoter

"Detroit to Chicago. This company has been the absolute worst. On my way from Boise Idaho to Detroit MI I was delayed two hours which caused a missed connection and what should've been 6 hours in the airport turned to 16 hours.

LHR-BKK return. The 777-300 in economy the experience was comfortable and indeed professional but it still lacked what we have come to expect from decent scheduled carriers. Cabin staff were efficient but the lack of little extras made the trip frustrating. No hot towels no pre-meal drinks service no menu card to choose from great difficulty in getting alcoholic drinks during the flight (impossible on the return flight despite repeatedly asking). They will have to up their game before we will consider booking them again.,Passive

We only had a light supper on board, instead of the announced dinner mentioned on reservation, justified by the 1:00am departure. Full flat bed on a long lasting night flight was welcome, even if being a hard one for European standards. Crew was always present and fully ready for servicing, until the last minute.",Promoter
12/2013. LHR-LAX. A380. Aircraft was clean. Seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the IFE- computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. Amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. There were no eye shades and ear plugs. Food both ways the same selection: Tikka Masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. FA's lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. There was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. IFE-system is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. Due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. This experience with British Airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating.,Passive

Sydney-Dallas QF007 on September 5 2014. Paying a premium for QF Premium Economy and looking at their website - I must say I was expecting something exceptional. This was not the case. 747-400 Seat 36K is said to be one of the best seats but if you are 6ft+ then this is not the case. The wall in front means you actually have less leg room than standard economy. The cabin was 100% full and the single toilet was used consistently especially by QF staff as their rest area was adjacent to it. Meals etc were quite good however it seemed economy passengers were offered ice cream/chocolates etc mid flight - but we were not (minor issue I know but at double the price I expected more). Was never offered a drink (except at meal times). An exit seat in economy would have saved me $2000 and been of better value I feel.,Passive

Flew MEL-AUH-AMS. Seats were cramped. Food was pretty good and so was the entertainment. Flight attendants were ok but they were quite peculiar about giving you more water. Being on planes for more than 15+ hours one gets dehydrated. Clean up after meals were too slow. It took them more than half an hour to come back and collect the rubbish. Transiting through Abu Dhabi was horrible. They make you go through security again and on our flight back to Melbourne we had to go through security twice.

But the downside is the cleanliness of toilets, it was horrible that I couldn't use.

"I've flown United Airlines many times, mostly domestic. They've been equally bad each time, but this flight bothered me more since it was a long flight. And maybe I've been spoiled by other good airlines that operate US-Asia routes. The plane looked a little old. Seats were pretty small (for reference, I'm 158cm tall). The entertainment screen looked like one from 20 years ago: touch screen, but you press five times and it still goes to the wrong button. However, they had a decent selection of movies and shows. I tried to play a movie but it kept freezing every five minutes. At first I thought it was just mine who had problems, so I pushed the call button for a flight attendant. 30 minutes later, no sign of any flight attendant, I gave up and already prepared to sleep for the remaining 12 hours of the flight. It turned out later, it was an issue with the whole entertainment system on that flight. After they reset the system, which took another 20 minutes, mine worked ok, but I know I was one of those lucky ones. The food onboard was terrible. I was pretty hungry but still didn't finish any of the meals they gave me. Well, they got me to Tokyo in one piece, so at least there's that. Bottom line: don't fly with United Airlines if you have/can afford other options.",Detractor
ICN-ORD in first class suites. After an excellent business flight from Sydney to Seoul I had high expectations for their first class product. Suites were very comparable to Etihad First Suites (probably not as luxurious though the design is very clever and perhaps better). Various functions of the seat made the flight some of the most comfortable I've experienced. AVOD was excellent and 32 inches made a significant difference in viewing. Seats very comfortable especially when sleeping. Crew made beds with duck down duvets and comfortable pyjamas also given. Meals were terrific and was washed down by top tier alcoholic beverages. Charming service from crew as expected and purser provided personal farewells at the end of the flight with gifts.,Promoter
"  Casablanca to Montreal with Air Canda rouge. Air Canada should see ""rouge"" with embarrasment. Travelling from Montreal to Casablanca proved to be a trip from hell. Of course those of us seated in the rear of the plane were left with the vegetarian option only as they ran out of the chicken dish halfway thru. The cabin crew had absolutely no control, people got up when not supposed to and most of their requests were totally ignored. The second beverage service was stopped halfway thru as it was time to prepare for landing. Hoping against hope the return flight would be a more assuring experience, the opposite was true. Again the vegetarian choice only, no offer of being able to purchase an alcoholic beverage (the traveller in front of me was told it was too turbulent to serve wine). Two of the staff sat in the back playing on their phones, a third had a blanket over her head trying to sleep. The second beverage service never took place but people routinely went to the back to get their own coffee or whatever else they needed.

When asked a question, one of the handlers held up her hand and rudely said, ""Hold your questions."" They gave $7 food vouchers about 10 minutes before all of the concessions closed at LAX. I telephoned Norwegian's customer service and was hung up on several times, as were other travelers on the same flight. During the flight, they served the food that was stocked for the original flight. The steak was grey and completely inedible. The cabin crew basically turned off the cabin lights and hid in the galley for the flight. I missed my connecting flight, my hotel, my tour and had to rebook my connecting flight at a double the rate. It will take 6 months for Norwegian Air to reimburse me for these charges. My return flight was also delayed 2 hours while they repaired the pilot's handset microphone. My return flight was a completely different experience with lots of offers of water or juice during the flight and (although tiny portions) somewhat decent food.

" Orlando to Chicago. I am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with Southwest Airlines. Let me preface this by saying that I have been flying Southwest for years, am an active rewards member, and currently have three upcoming trips already booked (booked before this experience). I flew out of Orlando, FL on Thursday night 5/24 at 9:15 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. We have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong."" He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. I called Southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. This complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a ""coaching"" lesson. Basically, this individual's egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through. I am beyond let down. I am in no way looking for this man to be terminated at all, but he does 100% owe both me and my husband a formal apology for his flagrant behavior and nothing is being done to rectify the situation appropriately.",Detractor

The food was actually quite tasty and my duty free shopping was delivered to me promptly and within minutes of me ordering my items. My only complaint was that the arm rest in the middle of the two side seats does not lift up all the way so having the two seats to myself was of no benefits because of this, I understand this is most trivial but it would have been lovely to have been able to get a few hours sleep before we arrived in Dublin. We had some light breakfast and some much needed coffee.

"  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.",Passive

Sydney to Honolulu on B767. I agree with some of the points raised by Christine Woodward on 2 October. This is business class from the late 80's. The seats were wide and I found them very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. Its true that if you are in a window seat with someone next to you you cannot get out without disturbing him/her. But there are only 5 seats like this. The cabin is configured 1-2-2 so there are 20 aisle seats out of 25 total. I didn't like the iPad system. You were always looking down on it you couldn't watch while eating or when the seat is in the recline position. However the staff were great - very friendly and offered excellent service. The food was good as were the wines. Priority boarding of business class - and they stuck to it - turning back economy passengers and telling them to wait.

However we went back to Barcelona and the pilot said that ground crew would tell us what to do, no ground crew were there and we were standing around wondering what was happening, We were ushered back through security then into the departures lounge where we had no idea where to go and the staff at the information desk had no clue what was going on, then we were told to go to a gate where we waited over an hour, people where getting tired and agitated, we were not given any food or drink. We finally left Barcelona at 4:30 with one apology from the new pilot and got back to Birmingham for 6pm - 5 hours behind schedule, its understandable that they had to turn around, but they should sort out communication with customers in these events",Detractor

LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).,Detractor
"We traveled with a 15 month old child from Amsterdam to Guangzhou to Auckland and vice versa. The crew were very friendly and took good care of us. You can't keep a small child in its seat all the time on a flight of over 12 hours so I spent a lot of time in the back of the plane with him. The crew was very nice to us and provided a nice ""playgound"" as well as (mostly healthy) food and drinks for my kid. This made our flights as well as the flights of other passengers a lot easier.",Promoter
"  The internet didn't work on an 8 hour flight and there was no other form of inflight entertainment. There was one plug that you had to share with your neighbour which is a little difficult if they expect you to use your own device for entertainment.

Staff were friendly and accommodating. Seats were comfortable.",Detractor

Today (19 Nov) when I tried to select seat, to my horror I found that my ADD-GRU flight had been changed to 26 Nov. I could not believe that 56 hrs layover had been added without informing me. It would have meant losing money onward flights and hotel bookings, not to mention the horror of sleeping at the airport for 3 days. I called booking office and they told me that flight on 24th had been cancelled. Anyway, the staff was able to change the ticket to normal stop over. Still, It's absolutely unacceptable that the airline would change flight dates without informing passengers (I notice that the website was selling ticket for the cancelled flight as recently as last week).",Detractor

Have flown with Ryanair on numerous occasions across Europe and in 20+ flights have never had a problem. You get what you pay for and as long as you read the small print and stick to their rules you can't go far wrong. My wife and I even used them on our honeymoon! It's worth doing your revision before you fly and check on destination airports and onward travel links on your arrival as some Ryanair destination airports can be a little out of the way.

"I flew round trip from New York to Manila via Taipei with my wife and 1 year-old son. EVA Air is one of the better trans-continental airlines to Asia. I think the service was better than I expected and seats in the economy class were comfortable. The media (movie and music) selection was fairly decent with new releases as well as classics. Although I wished they had more new releases to choose from. The food served included western and Chinese meals. So I had choices of what I wanted to eat on each leg of the trip. Every seat had a usb port which came in real handy to charge my iPhone. Since we had a 1 year-old toddler, we requested a bassinet at check-in, they had no problem finding one for us. Also, my wife and I bought our tickets separately, the EVA Air representative at the counter made sure to put my wife and I together. The ground crew were nice, they made sure the baby stroller was wrapped in a bag prior to boarding the flight. All in all, I was happy with the performance of this airline.",Promoter

Upon arrival my sister dropped me off at the terminal with our luggage and proceeded to return rental car. The American Skycap helped me get the luggage inside when I started to tip him, I discovered my wallet and phone were missing. Firstly the skycap called my sister continuously with no reply (kudos to him). I was panicked as you may imagine, my next contact was a very knowledgeable and caring ticket agent. She picked up her phone and tried to reach Hertz who did not answer her many phone calls on my behalf, then called airport police. Officer also attempted to contact Hertz with no avail. Finally, my sister arrived and went back to Hertz and the car and found my wallet and phone, all was well. I want to say a huge thank you to our ticket agent who also checked us in, for everything she did. When we reached the gate the agent they knew my name and asked if I had found my wallet. Kudos to the entire Ontario, CA Int, staff and especially to our American Airlines ticket agent.",Promoter

"Operated by Portugalia, two very different stories. On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage. Will fly LH, LX or LG in the future and avoid TP wherever possible.",Detractor

"  My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.",Detractor

"  Manchester to Sydney via Hong Kong. My husband and I were very unwell on a recent flight from HK to Sydney. Vomiting and diarrhoea for most of the 8 hour flight. We had already been on a long flight from Manchester to HK and began to feel unwell as we boarded the second flight. We only had 1.5 hour transfer at HK airport and we did not eat or drink there. We advised the cabin crew on arrival in Sydney (I had vomited in bathroom as plane taxied on runway) and although concerned to hear it they did not make any report or follow up. On getting home from the airport my husband then spent 2 days in bed, and I spent 24 hours. We felt unwell for several days. We contacted customer services and provided completed forms, as requested. We received acknowledgement of the forms (2 weeks after the flight) and were advised that the forms would be sent to the catering team and we would hear back. 5 weeks on from the flight and we are still waiting for feedback. We had expected that with a potential food issue there would be prompt action. Unfortunately this has not been the case. This is our first experience with Cathay and we had expected it to be a quality experience.

"  Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver. What an atrocious check-in experience traveling to the US. Stay away unless you're on a visa waiver, visa, permanent resident or US citizen. The check-in supervisors have zero idea how to deal with anything else and are a combination of poorly trained, arrogant, aggressive and power tripping. Two supervisors were involved and they were both the same. They don't know that other forms of US travel authority exist (a US Advance Parole combo card in this case). They had no idea how to type the Advance Parole combo card into their computer, so just wildly guessed, with one attempt before giving up. The computer then said I wasn't cleared to fly, because they'd typed in garbage data, which they insisted was what was going to happen ""because we don't have the authority to override the system"". Instead of just saying ""I'm not sure how to process this card, let me call someone who can help me"" their *first* opening approach is to say ""we have to offload you because you don't have a visa or permanent resident card and that's what our systems require"". No attempt to solve the problem and understand. Utter aggressive refusal to let me explain what an Advance Parole card is and that I am indeed allowed to fly to the US, you just have to call someone who knows what this card is. Literally I was trying to show them my phone and get them to read a paragraph from a US government website explaining what an Advance Parole combo card was and that it grants travel authority. They refused to read it - ""I don't care what that says because we have to do what the computer says and it says to offload you"". No matter that the computer only said that because they didn't know how to type this card in! Finally they call US immigration, after about 20 minutes of telling me they are going to offload me and aggression. They keep calling the combo card an ""Employment Authorization Document"". It has that in big print along the top, and the Advance Parole part in little print along the bottom. I keep trying to explain that it's a 2-in-1 combo card and to read the sentence on the bottom when talking to US immigration. ""We know what to say"". US Immigration answers, they refuse to read the bottom of the card, calling it an Employment Authorization Document and looking at me smugly. After many minutes on the phone the person on the other end finally asks them what is on the bottom of the card and they read it out with a grimace. About 30 minutes in after countless threats of offloading and one threat of calling airport police ""because we don't like you"" I am cleared to fly. They don't say a word to me, refuse to look at me. Just pass my passport to a check-in counter worker and say ""he's cleared to fly"". The in-flight experience was great, a near new Boeing 787. It was all destroyed by those power tripping poorly trained check-in supervisors who shouldn't be anywhere near a customer facing role.",Detractor

" Terrible service. I am currently waiting to fly from Charlotte Douglas to Miami, which was initially supposed to leave at 11:55, but has yet to depart. It's 4:15 and we are still unsure of our departure time. There was an issue with the plane, so understandably they had to find a new aircraft. However, since they resolved that issue, the pilot has been late, they have been unable to find flight attendants, and now - right before our supposed departure time of 4:25 - have to refuel the plane. Things happen of course, but the negligence and failure of AA to resolve these issues as quickly as possible is undeniable. This is also not the first time I have experienced significant delays on the airline. Furthermore, they have failed to give frequent updates to the passengers of what is going on as well as offer assistance to passengers with connecting flights.

"Chicago to Dallas with American Airlines. When you try to check-in online you find that all the seats cost extra unless you want a middle seat by the bathroom or galley. I purchased the Main Cabin Extra upgrade based on what they claimed the benefits are, but they withheld important information that would have made the exorbitant price they charged not worth it. One of their claims is that you get priority boarding - that is after all the AAdvantage and many other categories have boarded. By the time we boarded (Group 1) the plane was already full and there was no room for a backpack under the seat in front of me. The passenger in front of me had a huge bag overhead, another under the seat in front of him, and another under his seat. The passengers that did not fall for this upgrade trap saved themselves $180 and got exactly the same privilege and inconvenience as me. So a piece of advice - never upgrade online, you will get the same seats and inconvenience for free. Their preferred seat and Main Cabin Extra are not worth a fraction of what they charge",Detractor

Emirates is still one of the few airlines to offer a courtesy chauffeur service at selected airports, this is a huge cost saving and always appreciated.

The seats are spacious and luxurious. The choice of beverages superb, the bar at the back of the cabin an excellent escape, and great opportunity to socialise with other passengers and cabin crew.

Traveled business class between Bangkok and Colombo twice in last month principally because it is the cheaper than Thai or MAS. Terrible departure times 23.05 from Bangkok and even worse 02.25 from Colombo. Cathay now flies A330 instead of Boeing 777 which I think was better. Seat in capsule format very uncomfortable with recline minimal. In fully reclined position can't fully extend your legs. Three hour flight was just about tolerable. I wouldn't go for anything longer. Service on board is in a hurry to get things over as quickly as possible. Wine bought to you seat in a glass rather than bottle. Not impressed: Meals pretty mediocre.

The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.,Detractor
" Bangkok to Chiang Rai. Thai Smile started as a budget offshoot of Thai Air, but has become a mess. Staff seem angry (unusual in Thailand), service was poor, food and drinks non-existent.

"ARN-MLA 737-800. Travelled on one of these ""charter"" destinations with SAS. It's an all charter experience.

REP-BKK-REP. As the only carrier serving Siem Reap from Bangkok you don't have much choice. Service is an ATR72 or A320. The food is ok for such a short flight it's nice to have something to eat and drink. Beer is available so no complaints there! IFE depends on your aircraft but pretty basic. One important point I'd like to mention is that in certain airports there is a lounge for all passengers. One general lounge for economy and one of course for business. Not much mention is made for economy passengers but in here you get free food and drink wifi and a much more comfortable place to rest before (and after) your flight. For the short flight that this is approx. 1 hour what is provided is decent although a little over-priced.,Promoter
"Flight went very smoothly. No issues with check-in and flight departed and arrived on schedule, along with our luggage. Check-in staff and flight attendants were friendly. I expected a no-frills flight. Only complaint was that the departure time was changed at some point after booking without notification from 6.30 am to 5.30 am and I did not discover until I went to print our boarding passes a few weeks before the trip. But, still worth it considering the low-cost 60 euro/ticket cost for the non-stop flight, which included assigned seating and 1 check-in bag. I'd fly with Vueling again.",Promoter

"All 4 flights I took with Air Europa on my recent trip to Havana via Madrid, were either late departing, late arriving or both. The transfers were chaotic and badly organised. The first flight UX1014 to Madrid left Gatwick late, arrived late and as such I ended up running for the next flight UX51 to Havana. When checking in I asked if luggage had made it on the transfer and was told by the gate crew all luggage had transferred ok. On arrival in Havana, the plane was 45 minutes late as it had no docking bay. Amidst the total chaos at Havana airport and with no assistance from any staff or Air Europa representatives I had no alternative but to wait to see if my bag turned up, after waiting 4 hours and by 12.30 am to see if my case arrived I was told â€˜no more bags, maybe later'? I queued for another hour and eventually reported the loss to lost property and was given the receipt. As a result of these delays I missed my pre paid transfer and had to hire a taxi to take me to Havana at a personal cost of $30. After numerous calls, messages to the lost property etc I was eventually reunited with the bag 5 days later â€“ when I was in Trinidad, Cuba some 3 hours away. I will not bore you with the details of the arguments I had regarding who should pay for me being reunited with the bag, enough to say when I was told I would have to pay $400 for a private taxi to bring it to me in Trinidad my patience snapped. To continue on my cycle trip I had to buy toiletries,spare clothes, bag to carry them etc all of which I don't really want or need, I had to borrow socks and other items all of which is incredibly embarrassing and inconvenient. I had been no better than a nomad for 4 days on what should have been a great holiday, begging and borrowing, carrying my possessions around in a carrier bag. In addition to the loss of my bag I actually reserved on Air Europa web site seats prior to departure (at a cost of Â£48) which I did not receive these on the return leg â€“ no explanation just â€˜this is the only seat' at check in? Despite over 40 emails and letters to the airline they continue to ignore all responsibility to the point when I call and speak to someone in English they hang up on me!Customer serivce with Air Europa doent seem to matter at all I will do everything in future to avoid flying with them.

"Frequent flyer here. Worst flight experience I have had. Flight was supposed to be 53 minutes long. Got 44 minutes delayed due to late arrival of the plane. After boarding 15 minutes delay due to ""technical difficulties"". Smallest plane I've been in. Even though I wasn't planning on checking in my backpack the plane was so small that most passengers had to give their carry on luggage to the flight attendants to pick up from the luggage claim later. After landing (59 minutes after we were supposed to) the baggage claim carousel wasn't turned on until 35 minutes later! 2 other flights' passengers have landed after us collected their luggage from the carousel next to ours and left. Finally 40 minutes after landing (which is unusual for a domestic flight at a small airport) they started providing our luggage. The only good part about the whole flight was the behaviour of the pilot and the attendant. My ride was waiting outside for an hour and a half and I was extremely embarrassed. Never again.",Detractor

  I booked Qatar Airways to Male and had a boat transfer from Male to an island. But the flight got delayed by 3 hours due to late aircraft arrival and I missed my boat transfer. Qatar Airways ground agents told me to book a hotel in Male and take the next day transfer and get reimbursed the fees. I had to stay an extra night in Male due to this delay it made sense to me that Qatar Airways will pay the additional cost. So I submitted the hotel receipt to Qatar Airways but the customer service agent replied that they will not reimburse the additional cost incurred due to this delay.

" Houston to Denver. I wanted to change my return flight to stay in Houston longer. Trying to change the flight was the worst process I've ever experienced. It would take too long to explain it all - but suffice to say - it took numerous calls (about 6 total) to get the correct information and flights and they charged me 3 times for the changes - as if each mistake was my fault. I was in tears by the end of it while still on the phone with the rep. Then I went to purchase my bags online today, and it said my itinerary wasn't recognizable. When I called - and it's no easy task to get someone on the phone - I was told my first name was entered as my last and vise versa. The most basic info. If I had reversed my names, I would be told I had to buy a whole new ticket! Plus - they keep emailing me to check-in online but no matter what I do - it won't let me check in, and my flight is in less than 24hrs. I ended up paying over $500 for this flight home, and the whole thing has been a nightmare. I would recommend never flying Spirit.

HKGâ€“PEK last month on an A330-300. I am beginning to think that all the Chinese airlines don't keep a very good schedule because this flight was late leaving as have all other Chinese operated airline flights we have been on for our trip. Upon boarding we both noticed that the FA's were very nice and extremely helpful to us. Aircraft was either new or had been refurbished because everything was spotless. After takeoff the FA's began there services. The drinks available were limited. The most popular American whiskey in the world was not available so we had to accept lesser things. The food was good and all the services were done well. The FA's English was sometimes not too good but both sides were able to make the other understood.,Promoter

I booked my flight from Rome to Los Angeles with Air Canada which I have flown with before and enjoyed. It was not until I received my booking confirmation that I realized that the first leg of the trip (Rome to Montreal) was with Rouge and the second leg (Montreal to LA) was with regular AC. After having already committed I checked the reviews for Rouge and became startled. All of the negative comments had me dreading the trip. It is a long flight and to be cramped would suck. Much to my surprise and pleasure the seats were fine! Of course I have noticed that most of the negative reviews were for Airbus planes and we flew on a 767 but the seats were identical to the regular AC flight we took on our second leg. There was plenty of leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the Rouge flight than on the Lufthansa flight we took getting there. The seats were plenty wide. The staff were a little young but nice and cheerful. The food was great and plenty of it. I read so many bad things about the lack of inflight entertainment but then they played two recently released movies on the cabin televisions more than I got on my last American Airlines flight going the same route. Overall it was a great flight and experience. In fact it was much better than the second leg we flew on regular AC in that the staff sucked on the AC flight and they charged for snacks and food. The only thing better was the in flight entertainment was in the headrests which is always great. Bottom line I would definitely fly Rouge again and would recommend to friends.,Promoter

"  London Heathrow to Hong Kong, and what separates a good airline from an excellent airline is how well it handles unexpected issues. My experience puts Cathay firmly in the excellent category. Half way into the flight (6 hours in) one of the passengers required urgent medical assistance. The pilot made the decision of turning the plane around and making an unscheldued stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The crew dealt with the situation extremely professionally. The stopover meant an extra 4 hours added to the journey, which meant I missed my connecting flight. On landing in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific staff were waiting to assist passengers with connecting flights. Amazingly they had already sorted out onward flights, new boarding passes and for those who had onward flights rearranged for the next day like me, they had already organised overnight accommodation and transfers. I didnt have to ask for anything! Every detail was explained and sorted out for me before I'd even stepped off the plane.

" Christchurch to Dubai via Guangzhou. I took a flight from Christchurch to Guangzhou on 22nd December and had a connecting flight to Dubai on 23rd December. Due to the terrible weather conditions in Dubai, the flight was diverted to Muscat. Weather conditions are not something airlines can control. What was astonishing was their lack of customer service. They threw us in an airport and then did not even reach out to us with an update for 12 hours. They then took us to Sharjah, because they did not land the flight in Dubai at the allotted time. All passengers disembarked at Sharjah and zero attention was given to transit passengers (with no UAE Visa and hence no way to leave the airport). The airport manager at Sharjah had to speak to the staff at China Southern, and we basically had to hoard the captain from the previous flight in order to get them to arrange for someone to get us. 6 hours later, they fly us to Dubai (with our luggage still in Sharjah). Now came the icing on the cake. They were completely reluctant and unwilling to arrange us flights to our final destinations despite us continuously begging them to do so, their excuse being ""We are doing it"". We met the most rude China Airlines staff there too. 8 hours into waiting, I had it and bought myself a new Emirates ticket out of Dubai.

I flew from Dulles to Keflavik round-trip recently and thought this was one of the better airlines that I had flown with. They had good legroom comfortable seats the flight staff was very courteous the flight was smooth overall the plane was in good repair with excellent in-flight entertainment including several really newly release films that I'd wanted to see. I was impressed. Also I loved the slogans on their seat backs and they had really nice overnight blankets that were much fluffier than what you usually get on planes. It was a cushy ride which was good since one flight was an overnighter. The only thing that could have been improved would have been more food selection which was very minimal with just a few options although what they did have looked good and they had a great drink selection on board. Of course a larger plane also would have been a plus since it was just three seats on each side. Otherwise I would take Icelandair again from the US to Iceland over another airline any day.

It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay.

So I tell him that I have already checked in my bag before. He replies that I have to go back to the arrivals, walk to the Lost & Found Items office to get my bag and then go back to his desk. They are not only cancelling my flight but I also have to do their job in fixing the bag situation! I walk again all the way to the arrival, I go the office and they let me access to the luggage area. I get my bag and walk again to the check in desk. I finally get my new ticket, drop again the bag and I ask for an express pass because I have already queued for 40 minutes and I don't want to waste my time again. I ask for a special pass at the Zurich airport cause I have to go thru borders and I only have 50 minutes available. The guy refuses to do so because these privileges are only given to First Class passengers. After all this drama, I finally go on the plane and I understand why they have cancelled my flight.

"  London to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Outbound first sector on A319 fine. Good meal with well-cooked grouper as a main. Pretty impressive for short haul. Unfortunately this was as good as it got. Discovered that no lounge airside after passport control in Lisbon, so had nearly two hours to wait in main terminal building. Boarding somewhat chaotic - aircraft to Rio an ageing A340. Cabin crew not very welcoming and the leather gloves the females wear make them appear as if they are about to strangle someone rather than provide a service of hospitality. Seat format is 2-2-2. I had chosen a central seat several weeks before in order to have as much sleep as possible and neither disturb a neighbour, nor be disturbed by one. Having settled into my seat, I was staggered when the purser called at me across the aisle to ask if I spoke English, and pressured me to move, asking loudly in front of a couple who wanted to sit together - one of them in my seat. (If somebody had a medical need, it would be a different matter. Similarly if there was a genuine requirement on the part of the operating crew. That was not the case here. They had simply not organised themselves in time.) I was therefore obliged to sit in a seat I did not wish to be in throughout the flight. My fear of being disturbed by the new seating arrangement was realised.

I was told to check-in guitar, which I did not want to as guitar would be broken or have scratch. I had previously flew with guitar in more than 6 aircraft companies, they were really friendly and never stopped in from carrying guitar. I had a really bad experience in Hong Kong airport. Crew in airport were not friendly and were laughing speaking in there language after telling that they can not allow me to take guitar, as if it was fun for them. I did not feel good and did not want to pay to this people so left my guitar which had been my best friend from past 6 year. I would suggest not to take this airline if carrying guitar.

Amsterdam-Riga-Amsterdam. This was the last leg of intercontinental flight. All went smoothly however got a feeling of very impersonal service from AB. I also faced some level of check-in staff incompetence in Riga airport â€“ my checked in luggage on the way back to Sydney was forwarded to Malaysia only â€“ not to my final destination. According to them that was the only option they can do despite my KLM multi-leg ticket. I had to cross Malaysian border control just to collect my bag check it in again and come back into departure area for the flight to SYD. Fortunately this was the only odd thing I experienced.,Passive
TPE-NRT onboard BR2189 a special Hello Kitty Airbus333 jet. Though it was a short regional flight (3.5hrs) the Business class service was excellent. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming but most wonderful of the experience was the food on board. Flights originating from TPE carry special food prepared in collaboration with Taiwan's Din Tai Fung restaurant-something you must pre-order online before the flight. The chicken soup and steam dumplings (siaolungbao) were exquisite and memorable even though they were heated on board again. The sparkling wine a sparkling rose served was light and fruity and went well with the food. Though this is not a lie-flat seat but instead a reclining one inside a pod I was surprised how comfortable it was and how long it could stretch (I am pretty tall). So I even managed to take a nice rest on the shortish flight. Highly recommend it and definitely good value for money.,Promoter

"  I had travelled on the early morning flight from Mumbai to London on this Air India flight and was pleasantly happy with the experience on this flight. The flight departed on time and the load on this sector was quite a bit. After takeoff, the breakfast service commenced and as I had opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea. The breakfast was very tasty and sumptuous. The inflight entertainment was ample for this 9 hour journey and had sufficient programs to keep one occupied. I also managed to get a few hours of sleep aswell in economy class. The seats are comfortable enough and there is ample legroom. Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent and we arrived also perfectly on time which was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would definitely fly again with Air India and recommend this.",Promoter

Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure.

Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing).

A very poor substitute (A340) to the Dreamliner for the Stockholm-New York flight with a second-rate Portuguese speaking crew. Warned through a text message that no inflight entertainment was to be expected on board reading light was non functional probably connected to the entertainment system which was not turned on. Cabin temperature was at a very low setting so cabin crew could sell blankets for 5 dollars a piece. Food service was slow and dinner/breakfast were of mini-sized quantity.

BKK-VIE return on 777-200 in Business. Service from the crew and chef was fantastic and the food was excellent especially out of BKK. However nothing can make up for the worst seat I have ever sat on. When boarding you are bombarded by 70's green carpet pale blue bulkheads and purple seats with wood grain shells and yellow pillows! That could be excused if the seat made up for it but it is impossible to get comfortable in any position as it feels like being on a hard lumpy narrow bench. I used 2 blankets to try and soften the seat / angled bed but forget sleeping. The cabin was too warm which only added to the discomfort. The 'entertainment' system is a joke - on a loop with fuzzy screen and cheap headphones. A total disappointment that the service and catering can not make up for.,Detractor
"When boarding in Sicily with my son, some people were told to have their hand luggage checked in as there was no storage left. This seemed to be randomly done as a family just in front of us was allowed to pass with two trollies, just as ours, although people in front of them already were stopped. As we were already 30 mins late, things were done in a chaotic way and they labeled my luggage in a different way as my son's. When I was telling them (communications if any was completely in Spanish!) they just kept telling me to get on the plane. I refused until the two pieces of luggage were labelled equally. At that point I already started to get convinced this wasn't going to be a happy ending.

At the check-in counter I was asked to pay for the extra weight a total of 450 AED (approximately $120) even if I had 1 kg extra! The check-in staff were indifferent about anything I said and I had to remove everything and carry in my backbag. I ended up with back pain and at the end the weight ended up in the plane, only on my back! I don't see what's the point beside having unhappy customers (even premium ones).

Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight). Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality, you now get the same half-seasoned and half-baked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is non-existent on many flights (yes, the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it). The quality of their crew has been degrading as well.

"  Los Angeles to London return. Paid extra for the Premium Economy seats. When boarded appalled that had to turn sideways down the aisle. From a safety standpoint I don't know how this is allowed, because in an emergency there is no room for rendering medical aid or even to evacuate properly. The aisle narrowness also proved a problem later when I tried to sleep (I am a thin lady and don't spill over seat sides) and I was constantly banged into by crew and passengers going down the aisle. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, the premium seats have a leg rest below the seat that lifts up and provides no comfort other than take away more space and leg room. These seats would only work if there are two family members of small stature seated in the three seat row by themselves otherwise they are useless. As it was my knees were up against the front seat and if the passenger in front reclines their seat you can't eat off your tray and well you feel crushed. On the flight back my seat recline button was broken and I couldn't sleep. The passenger in front of my mother reclined their seat after they had served coffee and it went all over her clothes and ruined them. I have been on budget flights such as Ryan Air and been more comfortable. This is unacceptable for a long haul flight costing as much or more than other airlines in this category. I flew Air New Zealand 7 years ago and it was the best airline I had ever flown and recommended them to everyone. It was the only reason I chose them again and I wish I read the reviews on this site before booking them over Virgin Atlantic or British Airways. I will never fly Air New Zealand again or recommend them to anyone. Look at the photos I have attached and you can see for yourself. I feel sorry for the crew having to work in such cramped quarters and especially for the passengers who were continuing on to Auckland. Oh and there is a feature on the inflight entertainment that allows you to order snacks drinks from your seat. This feature was only ever activated for a period of 30 minutes on each flight. I think this was done on purpose by the flight attendants due to having to navigate up and down those ridiculous aisles. Shame on you Air New Zealand. How far you have fallen from the top.",Detractor

The queues were poorly marked and no staff guided them resulting in abundant cutting in line and queue hopping - some intentional, some not. At one point a member of staff bypassed a huge section of the queue leaving many trapped in a limbo loop. It was like a mob. Out of 9 counters, 5 were set up though only 3 were operating.

The left-side rear bathroom door on the aircraft used for flight 904 from MVD to LIM on March 22 had an open gap with the doorframe, so after you sat down, you realized you were exposed to the galley. Cabin Crew were excellent across all 6 flights, unlike other airlines where they tend to disappear soon after take-off (Aerolineas Argentinas comes to mind). There are no seat-back pockets, so your knees enjoy a bit of extra leg room but you don't have a place to store small items such as your bottle of water. Not all flights offer blankets, but all flights get very cold (so, dress accordingly).

" Flew Johannesburg to London Heathrow. I have read many bad reviews of South African Airways so I was pleasantly surprised with our experience on board. Economy seats were comfortable, with sufficient legroom and recline. The only issue being the excessively stiff seat pocket. Anything thicker than a magazine is difficult to stow.

Food choices were OK and if your choice was not in their cart the FA's were happy to find the meal in another cart if they could. They went out of their way to help. Service was generally very friendly, polite and efficient. Cabin crew seemed to be enjoying their job too, which makes a change from the sullen service on some European carriers. Inflight entertainment selections were a bit dated but OK. The major problem was sound quality. On this flight the movie voice soundtrack at my seat was completely garbled (though the music track was fine). Perhaps the different language tracks were interfering. As I mainly wanted to sleep on this overnight flight this was not a big loss. Overall I was satisfied by SAA's inflight service, it was way above expectation.

Seats etc. were ok although outdated in regards to comfort which was probably because we flew with an older 777-200ER. However we never experienced such a bad crew: - Safety: they did not show much concern for safety or did everything in a rush. When they prepared the cabin for landing they were in such a rush that they did not even check if we had our seatbelts on. One of the crew members was more busy looking outside the door window to look at the islands. Service: very bad, slow and unfriendly. - Entertainment: best part of the flight, although the volume of announcements during the flight (even safety related) were so low you almost could not hear them which maybe was the reason why we missed a welcome announcement of some sort. - Crew did not care for the passengers or to keep the cabin tidy. Not once in a 5 hour flight they cleaned up the rubbish or asked if we would like to have more drinks. We had to hold on to our used coffee cups and cans even during the landing because they did not prepare the cabin for landing. Towards the end of the flight they served a small breakfast when the pilot informed them to prepare cabin for landing which put them out of concept and put everyone in a rush. This was by far the worst flight in a premium cabin we ever had. It was the first time we flew with this airline and after our return flight it will also be the last time. Compared to other Star Alliance members the difference, especially looking at the crew, is like day and night. Not recommended!",Detractor
We went to Iceland in January this year holiday was fantastic! Icelandair on the other hand awful company with no customer service. 50 passengers turned up at the airport who weren't told their flights had been cancelled. No communication from Icelandair at all. This turned into a 7 hour delay and a flight with WOW airlines instead. After returning to England I was offered no compensation at all and no reasonable excuse as to why they didn't contact us to tell us our flights were cancelled. Completely unacceptable considering how far people travel and the money they spend to travel to airports for their holidays. I would never travel with Icelandair again and would encourage anybody to think twice about flying with them. They treat their customers like dirt and think they can get away with it. You have been warned!,Detractor
"Flew on Egyptair from Athens to Jeddah via Cairo. Was delayed leaving and arrived slightly late, however they waited for us to arrive and took us by bus to the connecting flight. The flight to Jeddah from Cairo was by a new Boeing 777. Very spacious and nice plane. A big positive for this airline is that they allow 2x23kg baggage per passenger in Economy which is a big plus for me. Service good and all in all a good experience.",Promoter
"London Heathrow to Frankfurt day return trip. The Lufthansa lounge at Terminal 2 Heathrow is spacious, but gets busy during early morning peak travel times. With Senator card able to use that section of the lounge - which was clean and nicely presented, good choice of newspapers and magazines. Food here is provided by Do&Co which I tends to equate to a great quality. Freshly baked croissants at 05.10am on a Monday morning is nice to find. Onboard it was the standard Lufthansa short haul business cabin, with middle seat left empty. Breakfast was a cold plate choice and warm rolls offered, all of good standard. Newspapers and magazines also supplied in this cabin. Good info from cockpit and staff service was efficient. Return trip did not have time to use Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt - boarding by bus to a very remote stand. Late lunch cold cut tray offered, drinks and coffee, but service was not so good. The cabin staff meant to be serving in business class quickly disappeared to help in Economy cabin and not seen for the rest of the flight.",Passive
"  I planed a trip to Las Vegas and started searching for flights, most important for me was the flight time. It was my first time flying Delta and I and the rest of my family were positively surprised. Beginning from the ground service to the cabin I was impressed, the only thing I could say is that they could do with slightly better seats in economy class. Another thing I would like to point out is the ground service - lost and found items and damaged luggage. Unfortunately it happened to me that we lost important documents and my luggage was damaged. Delta contacted me right after we landed informing us that they found our documents and money. In terms of my damaged luggage, I made a claim, Delta responded in minutes, with a very professional service, returning the whole cost.",Promoter

" Our family of 10 booked tickets to the Dominican Republic, and they cancelled the flight going home. They have another flight the following day, and they said there is nothing they can do. It will cost us $1,200 to stay in a hotel near the airport for another day. The top tier customer service line said they cannot offer vouchers and almost directly said they don't care. They've offered vouchers to offset costs for hour-long delays before at airports (I've seen it), but they strand people in a foreign country for an additional 24 hours and don't care? We waited 2 years for this vacation and use Southwest exclusively to build up points. We will be cancelling our Southwest credit card and switching to American for all points and flights.

" I traveled on British Airways with my wife from Dallas to Lagos, Nigeria via London on February 23, 2018. I had an extra bag that I paid $200 for in Dallas, our flight got delayed in Dallas, therefore we missed our flight to Lagos. When we got to London, we went to the BA counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a Virgin Atlantic flight to Lagos. On getting to Virgin Atlantic counter, we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from BA, we decided to do that. I opened a case on BA website, explaining what happened and requested for a refund, as what happened was their fault and not mine. They refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy, I know this, but what happened was not my fault, but theirs.

"  Chicago to Nairobi return via Amsterdam. Many times there are 2 or 3 adjoining empty seats which would allow a tired customer to lay down and get some well deserved shut eye, except you cant lie down because the armrest only folds up about half way (45 degrees). This stupid armrest design is obviously been chosen to prevent passengers to lie down. Most airlines flying this aircraft have fully foldable armrest. I flew on Emerates on the same route last month and was happy to see foldable armrests. In another matter, I was told at the gate the Nairobi to Amsterdam flight was completely full, but there was one seat available in business and I might be lucky to get upgraded. I was seated in one of the best economy comfort seats 17C. Great, after take off the stewardess approached me saying she can offer me a more comfortable seat. Having flown extensively with KLM over many years, this normally means an upgrade to business. I took my stuff and followed her only to be shown a seat behind the bulkhead, which had absolutely no foot or wiggle room. It was one of the worst seats on the plane with a crying baby right next to me. When I tried to get my great 17C seat back it was already occupied. I spend the rest of the flight of about 7 hours standing up and walking around. Needless to say I am an extremely unhappy camper.",Detractor

"  Atlanta to Detroit with Spirit Airlines. Before placing judgment on a company, I like to give them the benefit of the doubt, this leading me to purchase of return flight tickets via Spirit. I am very disappointed with the service received during what was supposed to be a very short trip from Atlanta to Detroit. As with many flights, our departing gate was switched. Which is harmless enough, except it was never updated at the gate, leading many individuals from other flights to wait at ours, which was incorrect and inconvenient for them. Once we boarded the plane, we then proceeded to sit on the plane for an hour. In 20 minutes, they read the names of 10 people, asked them to grab their things and exit te flight. It took 40 minutes for us to be updated on the cause, that Spirit had oversold the flight and they had to figure out what to do. Part of that involved pulling people off the plane (some who had booked months in advance), without explanation. It took another 15 minutes for them to allow those individuals back on the plane. Following which 10 more minutes passed, during which they realized there was still one more seat open and they sought to fill it. It is unbelievable the poor communication and service provided by this airline. I guess for an airline that charges for everything once you step on that plane, good customer service definitely isn't included. Will never use their services again.",Detractor
"  Penang to London Heathrow via Bangkok. Started the journey off on its subsidiary airline Thai Smile in Penang where the boarding pass provided was nothing different than a restaurant receipt, the ground staff said the new system has yet arrived in Penang, hence they could not reprint the boarding pass. As Flew in Smile Plus, no difference between normal seats except being seperated by a curtain with the rest of the seat. Upon arrival at Bangkok, I went to the Royal Orchid Spa for my free massage, it was very good. The only downside is that it was only 30 minutes, you should add more ground services for business class passengers. Next, was the Royal Silk Lounge, it was average, buffet food. It was disappointing to be honest, I expected more from an international business class lounge. In flight, the cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Probably one of the airline with the best cabin crew. The food was very good, and in flight snacks as well. The seat was very good as well as the Amenity kit. Will definitely consider flying with Thai Airways again, but hopefully they'll upgrade their Royal Silk Lounge in Bangkok.",Promoter

The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.,Detractor

They actually make an effort to welcome you, chat with you, make sure your children are settled before you take off. Firstly, they have cost cut to the point of it being ridiculous. No basic amenities such as a toothbrush and a few pencils for my daughter to play with (unless asked). Service is unfriendly and rude. The amount of packaging for their food is huge - rubbish everywhere. They don't use a tray to serve you so you need to juggle individual bits of food on your little table. The food quality is poor - my salad was gritty and the greens were slimy. No walking through the cabin offering water in the middle of the night - you have to track it down. We have been fortunate to have bulkhead seats on 2/3 trips however the seat room is shocking - you would need to be under 160cm to fit.

" Las Vegas to Orlando. I went into this flight knowing it is bare bones: no free refreshments, uncomfortable seats, etc. And that's fine, you get what you pay for. My advice to pay the slight premium for a reputable airline, comes from their terrible customer service once problems do arise. My checked luggage was returned to me with the zipper mutilated (now it will not unzip) and the fabric ripped. Understandable, things happen in transportation and the expectation is that they will take responsibility for it and rectify the situation. Instead I have had a three week back and forth argument with customer service telling me that Frontier is not liable for normal wear and tear to baggage and I should have read the Contract of Carriage before flying with them, and me asking how my bag being mangled is normal wear and tear. If you request to be put in contact with a supervisor, they will ignore your request and continue to tell you that this is their resolution and they hope you will fly with them again. I even paid for the insurance and came to find out that it only covers lost luggage, not damage to luggage. So whatever problem arises (and there will be problems), Frontier will do everything in their power to avoid responsibility.",Detractor

The order in which passengers boarded was a bit confusing and the person ahead of me had a bag that was too big - he wasn't asked about it or charged. The seat was tight and there was no regular pouch in the back of the seat in front of me to put things in. Fortunately there was no one sitting in the 2 seats beside me so I still had plenty of room.

"  Disappointing A380 experience with Etihad. I had been looking forward to trying their much hyped Business Studio on the A380 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. What a let down! The term ""studio"" is purely marketing hype. The seat is very similar to the Emirates A380 business seat although way too firm and lacking the personal mini bar. The TV screen also seemed a little smaller than Emirates and it just didn't have the same luxury feel. The biggest let down of the flight was the catering. When I saw the menu I thought they had given out the economy class one by mistake. The only starter on offer was a bland fattoush salad and the only dessert a rather tired red velvet cake. There was a choice of 2 mains, a lamb kebab (tasty enough) and a vegetarian curry. Shame on Etihad for serving such a poor business class meal. The other big let down is the on-board lounge, which is basically just a round table next to the galley, seating at most 6 people. Compared to the bar onboard Emirates A380 fleet, this is poor. Very disappointing product compared to Emirates and Qatar Airways, especially in terms of food and beverage. I will avoid in future.",Detractor

Flew from Toronto-Rome-Tel Aviv on May 3 and returned on June 3. I was flabbergasted that Alitalia uses such old planes. There was no in-flight entertainment system on the transatlantic flight (both ways). From the comments on here and speaking with American friends who fly the airline often it doesn't seem to be case with U.S. routes (they use newer planes) so Canadian customers be aware that you will get shafted. I echo the sentiment on here: why bother and offer headphones for such clunky equipment? I will say that the flights left on time and arrived on time (minimal delays) and my luggage was waiting for me which is always a nice feeling. The food was just adequate. From Toronto-Rome they served for breakfast a puny Danish and Oreo cookies. My luggage was 3-5 lbs overweight and they said nothing so I appreciated that. Service was fine and flight attendants were pleasant enough but I think in this day and age not having an in-flight entertainment system for 8-9 hour flight is just unacceptable especially when pretty much every major European airline offers it. I will only fly Alitalia again if they have an amazing sale. Otherwise there are better options out there.,Passive

When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating.",Detractor
"  Abu Dhabi to Ho Chi Minh City. Poor quality business class. Staff were friendly enough but ground experience at AUH is horrible. They no longer accept E Gate cards, despite the fact that I recently paid 150 dirhams to get one. No alcohol served in the Etihad business lounge as it was Ramadan (Emirates manage to serve it in Dubai) and underwhelming food offerings. The lounge was very crowded at the morning hour. The flight departed late and despite us not arriving in HCMC until after 7pm, we were only served breakfast. How can this be?! The crew seemed embarrassed. There were only 3 of us in business class, so at least the service was reasonable. Nothing useful in the amenity bag. Rip off charge of over $20 to use WIFI (its free on Emirates). Overall the experience was disappointing and I wish I had travelled with Emirates for only a little more.",Detractor
" I don't complain often, but this is my second ever flying with Delta. I have met some really nice workers that work there who were very helpful. My only issue is, a couple of the flight attendants there and back were rude and seemed as though they didn't want to be asked for assistance. Also, I look very young. So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about ID'ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink that's on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. It's frustrating to get that type of service. As for the rest of the workers, they were great and very welcoming.",Passive
" Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller. When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs."" I didn't want her to hold my phone anyway, but what a thing to tell a guest. Phones could be full of germs, but you don't need to say that to a guest. There are many ways to politely respond and assume someone is giving you their phone to hold.",Detractor
My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,Promoter
SFO to Narita onward to Manila in the new business class cabin. I was impressed at the high levels of service. The food was good and plentiful. Entertainment options on AVOD could be better though I did find things to watch. Amenities were made available in the bathrooms no individual amenity kit given out in business but you get a pair of slippers. It was the first time with ANA and will not be the last they have an excellent product fine service and efficient.,Promoter
 Flew from Surat Thani to Bangkok Don Mueang for business. Booked for luggage and thus had a hot seat and also a meal. The service was standard Air sia and standard budget airlines. The staff members were polite as how usually budget airlines goes. Seat pitch at my seat (1D) was pretty OK. However I still cannot imagine taking budget airlines for long haul flights.,Passive
LCA-LGW. Historically I have been a fan and supporter of EZY but this was my first long flight with the airline and taught me that the business model translates very badly to longer stage lengths - I don't expect a hot meal and free newspapers - my flight was a nightmare due to a simple collision of demographics. The two passengers behind me were incredibly badly behaved obviously drunk when they boarded and the cabin crew served them each two Stellas and 6 double G&Ts. Cabin crew on commission are never going to not serve someone another round of drinks. These particular passengers made everyone around them's flight absolutely miserable. I don't even mind a bit of bad behaviour on a short flight going to EDI or HAM or somewhere it can even be a source of comedy but on a 4+ hour night flight I and my neighbours should not expect to have our seats kicked deliberately and be sworn at. I will fly EZY again on short haul but over about 2hrs the risk is simply too great of being mixed in with people who don't know how to behave and are in no fit state to fly. The 20 minute delay on the taxiway after landing and parking at theâ€œwrongâ€terminal (South instead of North) because they wanted the aircraft parked at the South terminal for the first flight out the next morning caused a lot of inconvenience and was a final twist of the knife to finish off a horrible experience.,Detractor
" Guangzhou to Sydney. The attendants are courteous and friendly. The seat was comfortable and the food was quality especially for the morning.

"Munich to New York JFK via London in Club Europe and Premium Economy. After flying up front on long haul trips for the last 15 years I plucked up the courage to give British Airways World Traveller Plus a try. First Galleries lounge at LHR was good and had my fill from the very good food and drinks. Upon boarding I was disappointed to find that the cabin was yet to be retrofitted with the new (allegedly) much better product. Despite its age the seat was comfortable but the only good feature is the foot rest which is quite adaptable and helps when trying to get some sleep. IFE has improved in the last 12 months with about 10 current films, although the screen is dated both in respect of size and resolution. As a Gold Card holder I expected a bit more personalized service, there was no recognition of my status at all. Crew were experienced and delivered a good service despite a full cabin. Food (Tandoori Chicken or Beef Cheeks) was excellent and virtually a Club World meal - in fact it was better than previous Club World meals I've had on recent trips. All in all good value for money when not paying full fare, and given that Club World is so mediocre, Premium Economy is adequate for flights 7 hours or under.",Passive
For me the self-check-in did not work out properly. In Wellington I was kindly assisted by someone from Air NZ . Also for my return flight home the self-check-in was aborted and had to go to the kiosk in Auckland. For my last trip from Auckland (NZ) to Dusseldorf (D) there I could only get a boarding pass for just the flight from Auckland to Sydney. For the other boarding passes I had to find my way in Sydney to get the next boarding passes. Very inconvenient and stressful especially when one needs an aisle seat because of physical handicap. Finally has it been handled well by the staff of Etihad.,Passive
"Flew economy London-Bangkok. On the positive side flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. The seats are decent for economy and the IFE has a reasonable choice. The disappointing thing was the poor service attitude of the crew who were mostly cold and stand-offish. The meal quality was fairly average for economy airline food but it would be nice to see a menu or be told how the food is prepared instead of just being asked ""do you want chicken or pork"". Also they are very mean with drinks i was given half a small plastic glass of wine with dinner. There was no cold drinks offered between the 2 meals the crew seemed to just disappear for long periods.",Passive
Doha - Manchester A330 seemed to be a new plane very clean and seat material bright and comfortable. Business class was full. Took off bang on time and was informed that dine on demand was available. When looking at the menu it seemed that there was only a choice of snacks or omelette and chicken sausage. Companions IFE did not work and had to be reset four times. For a seven hour flight I was very disappointed with the food offered. Flying to Thailand in February 2015 I will not be using Qatar for this journey.,Passive
EK230 2/26 SEA-DXB. EK775 3/3 DXB-DUR. EK776 3/14 DUR-DXB. EK229 3/16 DXB-SEA. First time flying Emirates. Found staff to be very attentive to our every need. On the first meal service our first choice of meal was not available they made a note and when they came back through with the second meal service they ensured that we got to tell them our choice before they went through the rest of the cabin. The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on. Food was excellent with great choices. Inflight entertainment is really the best I have experienced especially the aircraft that had the latest version of the ICE system loaded. There was no shortage of excellent entertainment to help pass the long hours on the flight.,Promoter
" New York to Jinan via Guangzhou. The on-board service is great. The crew were willing to provide their best service, including checking connection flight, giving advice regarding catching the next flight, and etc. However, I had a baggage issue at the departure airport that requires China Southern to communicate with the airport. They refused to help so I had to call the airport all the way back from China to locate my baggage and arrange the transfer.

BKK-KIX After a very humdrum and sometimes shoddy Royal Silk business class service from MEL switched to Royal First for the red-eye to Osaka on an ageing 744 with Thai's brand new first class product and it was excellent. Only 9 suites now in the 744 nose and each quite private though without the doors of Emirates and Singapore. Gone are the lurid pinks and purples now replaced by wood finish and beige's and neutrals. Very dignified and restful. The new seat is a fully flat bed with good bedding and comfort wear and it was so comfortable and the atmosphere so hushed I slept for much of the leg. Huge HD flat screen promised fine IFE but I settled for a canapÃ© and a glass of Dom Perignon from a gracious FA who reminded me of how service used to be on Thai back in the 1980s. Gently woken for a superb Thai breakfast of steaming hot and spicy rice soup with shrimp decent coffee and some delicate conversation wit the wonderful FA as we began descent into KIX.,Promoter

" Both the airline's website and the app would not allow us to check in prior to our flight on multiple tries. The uber got lost and made us no more than two minutes passed the airline's pre â€œ45 minâ€ check in. The flight was not taking off for well over an hour but they refused to let us check in. They then made us pay to change our flight to a 5 hour later one with a layover. We paid it and spent the night on the floor of the freezing terminal. Next day we get to our flight and even though our carry on bag was included in initial flight that the airline made us miss, after charging us for a flight change we were then charged again for a carry on bag. This is the 3rd flight and the only one they had an issue with and charged us for. It fit in the carry on size requirements and we were able to carry it on and place it in the overhead compartment but were still charged for it.",Detractor
Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. Tickets are cheap but the trip is challenging. Starting from the long queue at check-in in Rome. First leg was ok except for entertainment which is far below standard. Vegetarian food was quite good toilets ok with a variety of cologne hand cream etc. Good travel kit. Stopover in Riyadh - airport is a nightmare with no shops. Riyadh-Manila - toilets barely had soap and towels. Return Manila-Jeddah-Rome was a nightmare. Manila-Jeddah delayed 5 hrs. They provided food but nothing for vegetarians so I had to buy food. Arrived in Jeddah where staff were unfriendly.,Detractor

No good TV programs and the Music selection was terrible. On the upside the service was excellent and contrary to other reviews the food was good and plentiful. I didn't like some of the food but it was just food I don't like and wouldn't like on any other airline. This was our first flight with China Southern and our first in business class.

"  Chicago to Orlando. I have always heard that you get what you pay for, and hadn't ever considered Spirit, but a friend flies them frequently & has not had a problem, so I decided to try it. Big mistake! I live in Wisconsin, about 1/2 hour north of Milwaukee, but Spirit flies out of Chicago, so we got a hotel room for the night before our flight (because it was leaving at 6:40 a.m.). When we arrived at our hotel, I checked to be sure our flight was on time. This was when I found out our flight was cancelled & we were bumped to a flight 4 1/2 hours later. Absolutely no notification at all! We tried to verify via their web site, then called their customer service line. They couldn't even find our original flight & insisted it didn't exist, even though we were looking right at our confirmation! After at least 10 minutes, someone else finally got on the phone & said, yes, that was originally our flight, but the time was changed a couple times, then the flight got cancelled two weeks after we booked it. There were also two changes to the flight we were changed to, for a total of 5 flight changes. They say they notified us by email, but neither myself or the friend I was traveling with ever received any of those emails (and we're both very organized people). The really sad thing is, at 2:00 a.m. that night, Spirit finally sent an email to my friend saying our flight wouldn't arrive until 3 hours later than we had been told! Our entire first day at Disney would have been blown! Again, we couldn't verify this by their web site (it was never able to upload, even though every other web site worked), so we decided to go to the airport. No one there knew anything about an arrival time change, and our flight landed on time, so the one email we did get from Spirit was wrong! In the end, we ended up spending more because of paying for a hotel in Chicago that we didn't end up needing. Totally messed up experience. We will never fly them again. They only reason I gave them 1 star is because their seats are fairly comfortable & the crew was nice.",Detractor
"  Toronto to Cancun. Paid for Elite Plus and since they overbooked my seats, I was given another seat which was broken with the leg rest permanently up, going against all safety regulations, not to mention not given what I paid for. Leaving the resort, the shuttle bus did not show up until 1.5hours after the designated time. Meanwhile, no communication was made to the passengers about the delay and when we called from the resort, they lied to us saying first the bus was running late, then it broke down and then it would come at 8:40 am and showed up at 9 am. We arrived at the airport by a miracle, being the last ones to board the plane. When I asked Sunwing via social media what their policy was regarding ""delayed buses"" (because we strongly believe they just forgot about us and simply did not schedule a pick-up), they said ""we do our best to get the transfer bus there as quickly as possible and try to keep passengers informed on what's happening through the destination representative at the resort"" Love the world ""try"", not to mention there was no representative in sight at the resort. In fact, their competitor representatives were all advising us to take a taxi because we would miss our flight. Looking at their social media accounts, I've seen that many people had to indeed pay out of their pockets for a shuttle transfer to the airport because the buses were simply a no-show. Very unprofessional and should not be able to offer all-inclusive packages when they cannot live up to the expectations and required responsibilities.",Detractor
"My husband and I were disappointed with our WizzAir flight on 24 August 2015 from Sofia to Dubai. We booked this flight on 11 February 2015 (6 months before), and paid an additional 79 Euro each for the Wizz Plus package that includes all the extras. Shortly after our booking, Wizz Air introduced seat allocation and we used the Wizz Air mobile app to choose our seats (as there was no such option on their website). This was the most tedious process: after each seat allocation the app blocked me from further actions because I had to pay 9 Euro, even though this was free-of-cost for the Wizz Plus package holders. I had to call them onto their international Customer Care number after each seat allocation to clear the bill. After we finally managed to allocate the seats, we received the email confirmation from the Customer Relations Department (Wizz Air Hungary) for our reserved seats together on the 1st row. Firstly, when we arrived to the Sofia airport, we were given two completely different to our booking seats (not even together). After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours. Obviously those passengers refused to move and we had to be seated at the end of the plane far away from each other as the crew could not do anything and blamed ground handlers at the Sofia Airport. There were several other passengers on this flight facing the same issue (same seat allocation as other passengers), and it was very unfair and caused a chaos before take off. Passengers were still standing unseated while the plane was already moving. This completely ruined the end of our holiday as we had to travel separately for no fault of ours whatsoever. I send the detailed complaint to Customer Relations Department and also placed an official complaint using their website link. I also requested to cancel our upcoming one-way flight with Wizz Air in January 2016 from Sofia to Dubai. Since then I have sent them numerous reminders to respond, raised numerous requests online to follow up on my complaint, even called their ""Customer Care"" who could not or did not want to assist whatsoever and said that the Customer Ralations Department must have been very busy and get back to me ""shortly"". Until today I have not heard from them. This is the worst service I have ever experienced in my life, and from my experience, Wizz Air don't care about the passengers, their concerns or their comfort.

And now that ridiculous new rule on baggage is confusing, unfair and so time wasting. I can't really see the business sense of all that either.

"Everything went well and flights were all on time. On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic.

"UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner.",Passive
Outbound from Birmingham - Trieste on 11th Sept returning 25/09. This continual drivel about paying for boarding cards at the airport. Why do people persist in doing it? Print the boarding card before you leave for the airport. It's that simple. Priority boarding why? All seats are allocated before you walk up the stairs. I travel with Ryanair 2 or 3 times per year. No complaints. The main complainants are passengers who cannot follow a few simple rules. So why blame the airline for their own inadequacies?,Promoter
" Flew Las Vegas to Detroit. I purchased 2 tickets together and when I got to the airport it cost me an extra $36/$18 per person to sit next to my companion on a flight we booked together. Spirit please telll me why you would think I would not want to sit next to the person I'm flying with? It cost me $100 to bring back two suitcases normal size, I get there's a fee but now I'm at $136 extra. We board the plane, get in our seats and from there on it was the worst 3 hrs 45 minute flight of my life, the seats were the absolute worst, uncomfortable, small, could not sleep, could not move! There was no complementary snacks or drinks, everything including water had to be charged to a credit card and it was very expensive, two dollars for a cup of hot tea. No entertainment TVs or movies, I did not save money flying with Spirit after all their hidden fees. Quite frankly I would spend more to be comfortable and able to watch a movie then sit and save $20 by going with Spirit.",Detractor
CX100 SYD-HKG in Premium Economy class. On ground welcome drink and hot towel. I took the first row window seat and it was nice that next to my seat was empty. The meal was great not worse than Business Class. Inflight snack you can choose noodles chips biscuit or apple. One thing is not good enough in PEY cabin is that they do not have a restroom on Airbus A330-300. The 773-300ER has one restroom. I am glad that they still provide Business class headsets in PEY cabin. It helps reduce engine sound. The seat was just like regional Business seats. Flight arrived 35 mins early.,Promoter

Very mean airline and indifferent service. My luggage was 1 kg overweight on two flights with them and was charged for the 1 kg (around 2-3 dollars). I find this incredible. In my 30 years of regular flying I have never seem such mean attitude. Their allowance is a meagre 20 kg while most airlines anywhere is 23 kg. As for onboard service forget about it. I took a flight from California to San Andres Island at lunchtime and we were offered a soft drink only on this almost two hour flight. Flight attendants never smiled. I now understand why both flights were less than 80% empty. Terrible!,Detractor
"  London Heathrow to Bilbao. I fly British Airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure. But recently they are beginning to slip. My last flight was with two friends for our annual outing, this year to Bilbao. Cannot fault the staff or flight crew. However, the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid. There is now no reason to use BA for short haul when there is a low cost alternative. This cost cutting may well back fire.

We were sent to the cashiering department and asked to pay $950 per person for a flight that was 1.5 hour long and listed online for $120 dollars per person.

"I have never been more disappointed with a flight/airline as I was with Air Canada Rouge. The flight from Kelowna to Toronto was significantly delayed due to weather which is not and was not an issue. Unexplained delay to boarding. However, the additional delay to board after the plane was on the ground was not adequately explained. Our flight was originally scheduled to leave at 12.25. It was after 4.00 when we finally got in the air. For convenience travelling with an infant we chose to sit at the back of the plane. By the time the flight attendants served us here was no food other than chips, chocolate bars, nuts or granola bars. We were informed that the ground crew did not load enough meals. Another airline had the courtesy of informing it's passengers about the lack of entertainment system and advised passengers to bring a book with them. Why could we not have been notified that there would not be proper food items? We did not land in Toronto until after midnight and the availability to get proper nutrition was again limited at that hour. Poor entertainment choices - This airline no longer has an entertainment system installed and requires you bring your own tablet and they provide wi-fi to view movies they have pre selected. The movie selection was poor and very out of date. I am 5'9"", sitting in the regular economy was extremely uncomfortable due to the limited leg room. Thank goodness there was an empty seat between my daughter and I. Otherwise this flight would have bordered on unbearable. Flight attendants were very gracious. I fly a moderate amount and have flown with many different airlines and plane styles. This is unfortunately the first time I have felt compleled to write a negative review.",Detractor

I tried contacting the airline via live chat and twitter as they don't have a call centre. After hours trying to reach the live chat agent, I was told they could not do anything for me. Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in. The agent informed me that they will compensate the delay by providing meals which was just average. Boarding was quick. The flight was parked at a remote stand, and were transported by a bus. Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite. The sale of inflight meals and snacks was done professionally with a wide range of hot meals and snacks at affordable prices. The flight was uneventful and before arrival, the crew bowed and thanked us for flying with them.",Passive
"My partner and I travelled from London to Guangzhou on 14th August business class. Prior to arrival at Guangzhou we were advised that due to being short of fuel we were being diverted to Guilin. On arrival at Guilin we were then advised we would be remaining at Guilin due to bad weather in Guangzhou. After being held on the aircraft for over 3 hours we were then advised that the brakes on the aircraft were faulty and the aircraft was now unserviceable and we would now have to change planes. Some 4 hours later we were deplaned and left to our own devices along with all other business, first and economy passengers. All the lounges were closed and there was no help from the service desk or the crew who had continually fabricated excuses. We then had another 2 hours sitting on floor as all seats in the public area were occupied. When we were boarded on the new aircraft we were told it would be another 45 minutes as they were loading freight. The treatment of all passengers was appalling especially those who had paid a premium to travel either first or business class. It is obvious we were held on the aircraft for over 4 hours so that the airline did not incur additional costs for keeping the business class lounge open due to the diverted aircraft. Despite several emails to their office for Australia/New Zealand we have had no reply.",Detractor

"  Charleston to Indianapolis via Washington. The employees at the Ronald Regan Washington DC airport have no people skills. I missed my connection due to air traffic and was denied any type of voucher. The captain said it was weather related, but when we arrived there was barely any evidence of weather ever having occurred. This airport was the most unpleasant leg of my trip both going and returning. Employees were rude to me at every turn as if I'm supposed to know how these things operate. I was told to ""back up and get out of my face"" after running to a podium to try to connect with said missed flight when I was only verifying that the flight was indeed gone. I was told ""ma'am calm down"" when I came to the gate after being called and asked what I needed to do. I am very laid back and patient, so this was uncalled for.

Even though pod system the layout does allow for communication amongst passengers - the prior claustrophobic feeling has been eliminated.

Only minus is Munich Airport which has long walks and different floor levels to conquer till aircraft position can be reached.

They ran out of chicken and shoved beef on us which I protested and they had the nerve to hand me cold sandwiches with white bread and a thin layer of some meat they said was pork/chicken/beef which I handed back to them as well. The drinks are not refrigerated, open juice boxes sit in the galley, all you get is apple, orange, or tomato juice - you can't ask for a can of anything except Pepsi (if they have any left). They don't ask reclining passengers to sit up straight during take off. The announcements in English were barely understood. Staff is rude and not fluent in English. On other airlines, the pilot announces his route or tells us his name or does some small talk to make the passenger feel welcome - with Air China it's only a canned announcement as soon as you get into your seat.

Drinks were plentiful, including Mikkeller beer. Then designer chocolates and coffee. Free WiFi too. The weather at LHR was pretty awful which meant a 1-hr ground hold at ARN and then some wild scenes in the air as we came into London.

"Moscow to Montreal via Zurich with Swiss. Check-in at Domodedovo airport a breeze. The lounge next to the gate is very tired looking. Priority boarding respected. Flight to ZÃ¼rich was ok, breakfast poor. No fresh fruits, but champagne free flowing. Middle seat is kept free, but the new leather covered seats are very thin, and have a minimalistic recline. Lounge at ZÃ¼rich in terminal D is an oasis. Boarding to Montreal was a hassle. I was very disappointed with the brand new B777. Business class has 62 seats (too many), losing the special charm. Cabin layout feels cramped unless having a single seat. Colors are darkish, and my elbow pressed accidentally many times the seat control buttons. Drink served before take-off, and thanks that the cabin was max 1/3 full, service was friendly, and refills automatic. Lunch (I had a pretty good steak, presentation poor) served on a plastic tray, didn`t enhance the feeling. Few excellent wines, Swiss white, and Italian red. Entertainment selection very limited if compared to Emirates. The screen was nice size, fully touchscreen. After landing in Montreal, it took 15 minutes for the crew to open the door, even the captain had to come and help. Personnel at the check-in for the return flight were unfriendly, and rude. Air Canada Maple Leaf lounge very nice, modern and lot`s of light. Great view to the tarmac area. Boarding was announced in the lounge, but business passengers had to still wait a good bit at the gate due to poor coordination. Cabin full, and the person serving me not happy. Dinner, fish, was nothing special, more of an economy plus quality. I had to request for refills. Three toilets for the business class were kept clean during the 7 hour flight.

All four legs were in business class taken during November 2013. The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tourâ€of Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin. Overall my experience of Etihad Airline certainly falls into the to the 'Very Good' category and if I had to give it marks out of ten it would score a solid nine.,Promoter

We have traveled around the world and the first thing the airline ask for is your visa or permit in order to let you get into the plane.

She said usually you forfeit the funds, but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted, the 28th, then M-F call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. Well today the 28th from my tradeshow I waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone, at 9:15am. She was very terse with me and said it didn't matter what the ticketing agent told me Saturday, that I did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars I spent on the prior ticket I did not use. I said even though I was instructed differently by a colleague of hers? She said yes, and that I cannot be connected to a supervisor as she is the only supervisor.",Detractor
Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal.,Detractor
My wife and I travelled first class from Orlando to Newark recently. We were surprised to see there were no PTVs on the plane. When it was time for meal service we were told there was chicken dinner or a salad. We both don't eat chicken so we ordered salads - we were told they were out of salads. Policy for the 12 first class seats - 6 salads and 6 chicken dishes. Out of luck! We had cookies for dinner.,Detractor

" London Heathrow to Sydney via Jakarta. When booking I look for comfort and value. Garuda scored well on both counts. The London to Jakarta segment was on a 777 which was a bit noisy compared to, for example, A380. But the flight was good. The flat beds were adequately comfortable (so much better that the awful ironing board beds on Virgin Atlantic 787 aircraft - the worst Business Class ever). Flight attendants were excellent, the food of good quality and beautifully presented. We have flown to Australia with many different airlines over the years and Garuda is amongst the best. The second leg on A330 was much quieter. There was a bit of a stopover in Jakarta and the lounge is ok without being exceptional. Again the crew were excellent and flexible in terms of meal times, quite important with an overnight flight. I would recommend Garuda.",Promoter

We then filed a follow-up to the complaint Oct 3rd to inform TAP that we considered filing a complaint with the Danish authorities if we did not hear from TAP in 2 weeks - e-mail confirmation again, but after that still no reaction! I just checked the status today Nov 6th - more than 3 months later! Just information about that the complaint is received.",Detractor
"American Airlines is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown.

"Terrible experience seats are very small and crammed in. Pretty much same as Sunwing layout but seats are more uncomfortable. No TV screens you have to bring your own iPad apparently to access movies (and sit it on your lap or table tray - did not try this out but hear it did not work well). On way back to Toronto from Orlando (flight 1863 Sunday April 20th) there was a 10 hour flight delay due to mechanical problems. So instead of arriving home at 1pm we got home at midnight. I can understand weather delays or other emergency delays but this was ridiculous. The part they were missing was originally ""a small thing that should be fixed in 30 mins"" then that turned into another hour then another 2 hours then another 7 hours. I'm sure they knew at the start it would be a 10 hr delay - and had we been told we could have left airport and spent day at Universal Studios with our friends instead of hanging around airport. My hunch is that given the planes are older the delays are not unusual. One good thing: The staff were friendly.

Seat comfort was perfectly acceptable for such a short haul flight - a good amount of legroom, seat width that's as to be expected from a 737.

" Manila to Cape Town via Dubai. Emirates has been incredibly disappointing on so many fronts. The Special meal I ordered didn't show up. As opposed to being super apologetic the airline crew was just rather indifferent. Also the regular meals provided in business class were terrible. Business class felt like economy class service. Staff came out when there was meal service and otherwise just huddled in the cabin and chatted outside of that. Really got the distinct impression that I was bothering them every time I had to go to the cabin to get water. They used to be better. Not sure what happened to this airline. Airport Transfer: security check points to transfer from one gate to another along with an arduous bus ride. Amenities: Nice Kit but no slippers in the plane. Seats: This was the worst part.

The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was seriously the most money I have ever spent on an airline ticket ($1900+ per person) and the worst experience I ever had.

LHR to YYZ. We travelled in an old 767. On the inbound flight it was a beautiful big 777 and frankly much better. This 2-3-2 configuration was crowded on a long haul flight and there are only bathrooms in the back of the plane. Our seats at the front - you get it. I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times. I know first world problems - but when you pay for it. On a brighter note 'some' flight attendants were friendly (others not at all). We will go back to our regular Air Transat route across.

My nephew is just under 2 meters tall in Kunming the wheelchair China Southern provided to get my nephew from the check in desk to the aircraft was too small for him to fit in so he was allowed to use his chair to the door of the aircraft we had to carry him onboard and as he is so tall this was extremely difficult.

I declined to select a seat, pressed â€œnextâ€ and all of a sudden was given the e-ticket. At no point did the app prompt for luggage information (which would have cost 30 euros if checked- in in advance). The next day at the airport, I tried to explain this to the customer service desk, but they told me I had to pay 60 euros â€“ more than the cost of my flight! Further, our flight was delayed by 2 hours: we were supposed to depart at 10:15pm but instead, we only boarded around midnight. Since it was so late at night, the stores were closed and we couldn't buy snacks. Once we got on the plane, we asked for water, but we were informed that all snacks â€“ including water â€“ were for sale only. I have never had an airline charge for water, especially after such a long delay. This was unhumanitarian. In both situations, it seemed like the airline was capitalizing from situations that they created or that were in their control. I wrote to their customer service department explaining this and they still don't seem to get the wrong they have done. I have flown with many airlines around the world â€“ just within this Euro-trip, I had flown with 4 or 5 different airlines, of which 3 of them were discount airlines- and have never gotten such poor treatment.

Well, for American, that means basic economy. Flying on American Airlines went from bad to worse. I live in Dallas and it is tough to fly any other airline that doesn't have a connecting flight. So I am stuck... a gold member they can't select a seat, gets half credit for every flight, and just flies in misery.

NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,Promoter
"  Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Not really low cost! Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is â‚¬984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was â‚¬2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don't split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air. It may be low cost if you're lucky, but it can become a very expensive experience if you're not!",Detractor
"While we paid for Premium Economy (upgraded at airport counter), when we got to the gate we looked at our boarding pass and discovered our boarding passes showed the same seats as our original ones in Economy, even though we had paid for an upgrade. When we noticed this, I asked the woman at the check in counter for help. She refused to even look and see if anyone had been placed in our upgraded seats and insisted we had to go back to the check in counter, which was impossible at this point, to get an upgrade. We tried to clarify we had already upgraded, but the agent had not issued the correct seats. She was adamant and stubborn, to the point of extreme rudness. Her two co-workers just stood there and stared at her, but they couldn't help because obviously she had the seniority. I asked her for her name and she repeatedy refused until I raised my voice and insisted. She told me I didn't need her name. As I boarded the plane, I leaned over and got her attention and announced that I had, in my many, many years of flying never run into a counter representative as rude and miserable as she was.",Detractor

" In our instance, it was not all the airlines fault, but it was a very frustrating experience. We were coming from Mexico, and got stuck in an absurd customs line. We were prepared for an hour, it took almost 2 hours. I had booked the flights separetly. I did not know that the check in desk closes an hour before departure. We made it 45 minutes before departure but couldn't check in. The agent only told us to call a 1 800 number, and I waited on the phone for 52 minutes before someone answered. This person told me I could have cancelled my the flight a half hour before departure time, but that time had passed by the time they answered the phone. We had to buy a new ticket which was not cheap since it was for the next day. I hadn't intended to buy the flights on the same day, and when I realised my error, decided to risk it. Bad decision. For anyone flying Norwegian, I'd recommend that you read all of the info on their website. I didn't, and it cost us a pretty penny. In hindsite, I would have tried changing or cancelling online instead of calling - the person on the phone was not there to help me figure out a good solution, she just stated the rules you find online, and I was out of luck.",Detractor

After calling in and being on hold, I spoke to an extremely rude woman who did not understand and could not answer my basic questions. I was told that if I were a gold-card member that I would be able to change my flight but as I am just an economy member, there is nothing they can do for me.

" Paris to Riga return last June. Air Baltic lost our 9 year old daughter's luggage, which happens from time to time. That is understandable. We arrived in Riga on a Thursday for a six day trip. It took them until Monday night to get our daughter's bag to us in Old Riga, just a few miles from the airport. She was without shoes or a coat and we put off making purchases, knowing the luggage would be delivered quickly. As each day passed, we were given vague answers and handed off to other people. We ended up having to purchase clothing and toiletries for her, and Air Baltic refused to refund us for the bulk of the purchases, saying they would pay only 40 EUR. I was not upset that they lost our luggage. I am very upset, however that they would not resolve our problem until two days before we were to fly home, then they would not reimburse us for necessary items, and here is is mid March (this happened last July) and we still have not been paid the 40 EUR that they promised. They are treating us like we did something wrong, when we were just innocent customers. I will never do business with them again, even though the flights were fine and fairly priced.

They cancelled the outbound flight from Miami but did not notify me. I found out 5 days before departure by calling the airline to reconfirm everything. Fortunately I was able to rebook out of Newark for the same day of departure although this entailed an 8 hour layover in Lisbon for the continuing flight on to Funchal. The only other glaring negative was the food service on the return portion from Lisbon. The food was really poor. ""Priority"" luggage came off the airplane last in Miami.

Before take-off from London a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us.

Old Premium Economy seat had lots of recline but the legrest didn't extend upwards enough so it was essentially useless. Entertainment had a decent selection but the system was slow and not very responsive. Food was fine although some passengers were served using porcelain mugs while others given paper cups for drinks service which was odd. Inflight service was very inconsistent some smiling while others looked like they wanted to be elsewhere. Definitely not worth it if you paid full fare for Premium Economy. B767 was old although updated with AVOD. Breakfast was basic either continental or hot.,Passive
"  Beijing to London Heathrow, business class. Having flown out on Thai Airways, my trip plans changed and a last minute visit to China meant I got booked onto this return flight. I like China, I know and like the Chinese people, but this airline is just unbelievably awful. The lounge in T3 PEK airport was so crowded and hot, food absolutely vile, and I thought getting onto the flight might improve things. No! My neighbour sat and hacked up phlegm for most of the trip, occasionally spitting this into his glass or cup. God knows what germs he was spreading. The seat was okay, but cabin was dirty and had a pungent and very unpleasant smell. Forget the IFE as choices are typically Chinese limited. After the lounge food offering, it got worse on the flight and truly resembled and smelt like dog food - and this was the western choice I opted for. Final elements of enjoyment was when I walked to the toilet about halfway through the flight and noticed 4 cabin crew (in full uniform) spread out fast asleep on some vacant business class seats!

"We were told at checkin that out 5 and 6 year old children would be in separate seats across the plane as there were insufficient adjoining seats. Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane. Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats.

Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat.

Boston-Dublin A330 with 2-4-2 seating. New plane PTV entertainment friendly helpful staff and crew easy check-in on-time departure and arrival. Just one meal. Charge for all alcoholic beverages. Seats were cramped both width and leg room. Difficult to sleep since cabin lights were left on and crew was making frequent announcements throughout flight. Many were commercial announcements regarding tax-free goods. Dublin-Boston same aircraft type. Same pros and cons with one additional con - cost or change fee to re-schedule was â‚¬692. No forgiveness or consideration on non-refundable tickets. US passport control is now at the Dublin US flights departure gates. Easy to get through the passport control gates but the reduced space results in major congestion at the departure gates.,Detractor
"Had a wonderful trip to Prince Edward Island in August 2015, with one exception. We had Air Canada all the way there and back. On the way there our first leg, Vancouver to Calgary, second leg, Calgary to Halifax, Air Canada Rouge. Air Canada Rouge was awful. We flew out of Calgary at 1130 at night and were met by stewardesses with top hats and fancy slack outfits. Once on the plane we were squashed in seats with no TVs and offered to rent Ipads for $10 to watch TV. The other thing was someone had their cat on the plane in a crate and got moved to first class because the cat was upset. I'm sorry but what about the rest of us. Just a heads up to anyone travelling in the near future. Would not travel Air Canada Rouge again.",Detractor
OSL-TXL. I was originally booked to fly with Lufthansa. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing of Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on their direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. Check-in and boarding for this SAS flight were a breeze. The onboard service was very good and the staff were very friendly. I definitely recommend SAS on this sector. I had paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS is cheaper more reliable and better than the competition.,Promoter
"  Chicago O'Hare to Calgary. I bought a first class ticket at full fare, which was at least twice the coach fare. I had my seat selected and confirmed and paid in full of course. On the day of the flight I checked in. While waiting at the gate I saw on their United Airlines screen the names of 2 passengers upgraded to first class. Shortly thereafter I was called and I was told I was downgraded to coach because they were overbooked! They said they would give me a voucher of $250. I was appalled and I felt that I was cheated by United Airlines. The staff at United gate said they were overbooked and I was downgraded because my fare was the lowest of all the first class passengers on that plane. But I paid full fare and it was the lowest probably because I bought the ticket 6 months in advance - but it was a full fare and it was still more than twice the fare of coach. The staff member said I could either wait 3 hours for the next flight or fly coach this flight. I asked why they upgraded 2 passengers to first class and downgrade me when I paid full first class fare. This staff member denied that they upgraded anyone. (Another passenger whom I didn't know later confirmed to me that she also saw on the TV screen 2 passengers upgraded.) I said I was going to complain because I felt that United Airlines cheated my money because I paid full fare for first class and they put me in coach for a voucher of $250. Their staff said, ""Go ahead to complain. I am just carrying out company policy."" They never even apologised the whole time.",Detractor

First time flying Delta was a terrible experience and I will never fly Delta again. Check in was really bad.

"San Francisco to Bologna via Frankfurt. Excellent airline and polite staff. We feel that passenger safety is their priority which they have proven on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, they should do something about their partner airlines whose professionalism is not as high. On the San Francisco Airport, the staff of their partner airline didn't want to let our 12 year old son into the Senator Lounge because a Gold membership card allows only one guest. They asked us to pay $59 for him to enter for only 1 hour (the time we had before our flight to Frankfurt) which we okayed. As if $59 was not enough they said that our MasterCard didn't have any money on it (not true) and on top of it all didn't want to accept cash. So they turned us away. This has never happened to us before. We were allowed to go into every single lounge around the world without paying an extra fee for our son. Bad image for Star Alliance indeed.",Promoter

Flew from Brussels-Dubai-Tokyo and back again a total of 34 hours on Emirates planes. Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is. Families with young kids also get complimentary strollers when they land.,Promoter
Recently flew from LAX to San Salvador and then on to Lima Peru. I thought the flight down was much better than the flight coming back. Got a special rate which was nice. Staff were excellent on my first flight and very helpful. Food was good as I am a vegetarian so requested special meal which was pasta salad and a roll. Seats were very comfortable. Plane was on time and I had a short layover in San Salvador. The flight coming back was different. Food was a ravioli dish but it was too hot to eat and covered with too much cheese. I didn't eat it. Movie was a film which I had already seen. Had a 5 hour stopover in San Salvador and tried to get on an earlier flight. Was told that a change to the earlier flight would cost me a change fee and I did not want to do that so waited the 5 hours in San Salvador for the later flight.

" Atlanta to Des Moines. I don't know how people, particularly anyone over 6 feet tall, routinely fly on Delta. Their jets have the worstâ€”leastâ€”amount of legroom of any airline I've flown. I'm 6'4"" with long legs, and the seat I was in had just enough space behind the seat in front of it to allow me to wedge my legs into the space, but I could not move them side to side because of the people beside me. Consequently, I had to sit for 2 hours with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me, with all the obvious discomfort you can imagine. Luckily, the lady in front of me did not recline her seat. That would have been an even greater amount of pain. Seriously, why does Delta pack these seats so closely together? Do they not realize there are people out there taller than 5-1/2 feet? They should make one-third of the rows with larger leg room, and reserve these seats for people of a minimum height. Delta is my last resort for flying, and the only reason I had to settle for this flight was it was the only direct flight option for me. I guess I should stick to American and just accept the added hassle of connecting flights and layovers just to get a more comfortable ride. Come on, Delta!",Detractor

After years of having an extremely lax baggage policy, where they didn't charge anything to check in the first bag, let excess kilos float through without comment, and never paid any attention to cabin bags, Aeroflot has done a complete U-turn. Now you have to pay for luggage in the hold (Â£36 per item) and they are applying zero tolerance for a few grams over and weighing hand-baggage, applying limits to the letter. My excess on the same amount of luggage I've travelled with for years came to Â£129, almost doubling the price of my ticket. It was extracted by the service staff, at times barely suppressing smiles.

I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this.

"  Madrid to Manila via Doha. Our inbound Iberia flight was delayed. It was a race against time.

When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well.

I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable.

"This was my return leg to Brussels via Doha on Qatar business class. The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg.

On arrival we had to wait at immigration for 15 minutes as no arrival cards were provided on board and there were none left at the airport on arrival.",Detractor
" Orlando to Minneapolis. Delta used to be one of the best airlines apart from Alaska, they used to take customer service seriously. I haven't flown much in the last several years but due to work I am beginning to travel on a weekly basis. Delta has obviously gone downhill in the last several years. Not putting families together when flying, not able to assist with seat changes to accommodate families, and this entire process change. This will be my very last flight with this company. It's sad how they've taken Northwest Airlines amazing customer service aspects and simply thrown them down the drain. What a shame.",Detractor
"China Southern Airlines from Auckland to Amsterdam return, via Guangzhou. On my return flight from Amsterdam to Auckland I could get only the first boarding pass from Amsterdam to Guangzhou and was told, the second boarding pass would be waiting for me in Guangzhou. That boarding pass was handed to me by the staff at the airport in Guangzhou. However, the seat was number 44D, a seat in economy class, while I had booked and paid for Premium Economy. I questioned the allocation and the stewardess referred me to the head stewardess who referred me to staff outside the plane. Unfortunately the command of English language of staff was very limited, so he was either unable or unwilling to give an explanation why I was not offered the seat I had paid for. The plane had a premium economy section. All he was explaining was, that it is not his fault and I need to complain to the ticket issuer in Amsterdam. I wasn't concerned whose fault it was. I only wanted my premium economy seat with more leg room - I am 66 years old and have severe leg problems in the small economy class seats. The unpleasant conversation ended in an ultimatum by the staff to me, either to leave the aircraft or to accept that seat on offer. I accepted the seat under protest. What makes the whole issue particular galling is the fact, that I changed my initial booking with China Southern Airlines. I had overlooked that the flight via Beijing was economy only for the last flight, Beijing to Auckland. Given my leg problems I paid the penalty for changing the flight to Guangzhou to ensure I would fly all the way premium economy only to end up in a situation I desperately tried to avoid. I had requested Asian Vegetarian meals for my flights, but was offered a vegetarian meal only on the first flight. The other three flights I was offered meat dishes and only after pointing out the fact, I had booked Asian Vegetarian, I was offered an alternative, usually ""vegan ""which I don't like but had to accept in the circumstances. There were problems with the onboard entertainment systems. Only on the first flight everything worked. On the three remaining flights I wasn't able to operate the touch screens and on the advice of the stewardesses I used the controls in the armrest. However, even with the assistance of the stewardesses I was not able to watch any movie. All in all, a very disappointing first experience with this airline. China Southern Airlines refused to repay the difference and never got in contact with me despite my request.",Detractor
  Toronto to Delhi. I flew the Boeing 787-9 on a long 14 hour flight to Delhi. This aircraft is not suitable for long flights. Seat pitch and seats are so uncomfortable that you can barely sleep during flight. Aisles are so narrow that you get bumped by passengers moving back and forth. Service was okay and lack any surprise.,Detractor
"Check in was fine with Norwegian for our flight from New York JFK to London Gatwick. A lovely and helpful woman. Plane was good. Staff on flight were terrible. Wanted to ask for water and the woman serving did not hear me. As she passed by I very gently touched her with 1 finger. You would have thought that I had attacked her with the way that she reacted, she turned on me in a very rude manner. We were not handed landing cards and when we asked another attendant (male) he said the plane was late and therefore they had not been given landing cards in an off handed manner as if it wasn't important. Asking $5.00 for a blanket was also off putting. You pay for everything. To be honest the only reason we flew Norwegian was because it came with our deal on the Queen Mary. We live near Gatwick so thought it was a great idea to fly into that airport. Frankly, I doubt that we will ever fly Norwegian again. Convenient or not.",Detractor
"Manchester to Montevideo via Madrid. I booked the flights early in the year and a few months later Iberia changed the longhaul flight schedule and my original dates were no longer possible. Rebooking was a big hassle and the first person I had to change the reservation was useless, the second one a bit better but I ended up having to cut my trip short 3 days. Flight from LHR to MAD was in a super plane but then we got on the long distance flight from Madrid to Montevideo and it was all downhill from there. My seat was broken and I basically sat on a metal pole for 13 hours. On the way back same old plane and my seat was broken again, this time I couldn't recline. This time they showed a couple of films but like on the flight to Montevideo no flight information. Food was poor on both trips and on the MAD to LHR route we even had to pay. Nobody walked through with drinks on the long haul - you had to get out and get things yourself and climb over sleeping passengers to get out. On the way there the steward was nice but on the return flight the steward was rude and told off my little girl for going to the toilet and made her cry. The connection to Manchester on return was also bad - 3 hours connection time in LHR for the 30 min trip to Manchester after already travelling 17 hours. I liked getting the gates for the connecting flights texted to my phone but guess all the other big airlines do that too now. So next time I go to South America I won't be flying Iberia. It was the cheapest option to get to Montevideo at the time but now I wished I spent a bit more for better planes/service.",Detractor
" Johannesburg to Edinburgh via Doha. Qatar Airways provides a decent service with their flights, but other areas are lacking. You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude. This was ridiculous.",Detractor

LHR-CAN-MNL and return. I must admit that when I booked with China Southern I was a bit nervous about it as I had read several poor reviews but I needn't have worried as all the flights were fine. We were travelling with a 6 month old baby which proved to be no problem. There was no bassinets available on the LHR-CAN leg (which was fine as my daughter will not sleep in a bassinet at all) so they gave us a row to ourselves so we had plenty of room. They gave us a row to ourselves on all legs thereafter. Flights were on time. Dreamliner was all fresh and new. Food was as good if not better than other airlines I have flown with. All the staff were pleasant and very helpful - especially with the baby. The layover in Guangzhou was overnight on both outward and return and they provided hotels each time. Both hotels were of the highest quality. We managed to miss the bus to the hotel on the outward leg so they upgraded us to the Pullman Hotel at the airport which is only a few mins walk. We will definitely fly with them again.,Promoter

"  Short afternoon flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen in SAS Plus. Check in and security swift and uncomplicated. Arlanda lounge is your typical busy SAS 'ikea' lounge. The flight itself was very unpleasant. Boarding was late and an unorganised scrum. Seated in 1F with minimal legroom and felt very squashed in, due to the curvature of the plane. Also, the middle seat was occupied, adding to the squeeze. No chance to move to a better seat as the flight was jam packed. Service was a pathetic cheese sandwich. If you have Star Gold status then SAS plus is a complete waste of money, as basically the only 'perk' is the cheese sandwich (lounge, check in, boarding etc.. all covered by Gold Status) The plane was old and filthy, the cabin crew young and fresh. Transferring to economy with Austrian Airlines and the difference was remarkable - a clean fresh cabin, spacious seating and the same free on board service that you pay extra for with SAS. Will avoid SAS at all costs in future - very much a low cost carrier.",Detractor
"I had the journey from hell with Air Europa, flying London to Havana via Madrid. Starting from check-in at Gatwick Airport, there were only 2 counters open for the flight to Madrid, which extended the check in time to 1hr 15 mins. This left me with no time to buy food and other necessary things for my trip. I had to rush through security, then rush to the gate hungry. Arriving in Madrid the plane was held without the doors opening (which happened the previous time I took that flight and the same excuse was given) for 20 minutes, so I had to again rush through to my next flight. After boarding we were held inside the plane for 2 hours before it took off, which was exhausting and considering the lack of oxygen suffocating, besides the fact that I was now starving. As soon as I boarded the plane, one of the cabin staff wanted to move me from my seat without any explanation. He kept dragging me to different seats all over the plane and when I enquired why am I being moved, he got angry that I am asking. Then I thought luckily I was given a vegetarian meal (which I was not on my previous flights to Havana and back despite booking the meals in advance and even though I complained officially and filled up forms I received no response). The meal was horrendous. It consisted of half-cooked pieces of green beans and carrots and a rice. When I asked the air-hosted for another piece of bread she completely ignored me and never gave me anything. Then after arriving in Havana with over 1 hr delay and waiting for 1.5 hrs for my luggage it was lost with no record where it was. The Air Europa representative told me it is not her problem where my luggage is and that I should call head office in Spain for details. I called the office the next day and they ensured me my luggage is arriving that night with the 6.50pm flight and I will be immediately contacted by their representative to arrange delivery. At 10pm I had still not heard from anyone from Air Europa. I called the airport and was told by the airport staff that my luggage was there and with Air Europa and it is up to them to release it. At 11pm I had to take a cab across Havana to go to the airport to collect my luggage. As a result I had incurred additional expense of cab, telephone charges, buying temporary clothes, having to cancel a trip to another province in Cuba. Out of a 10-day trip, I went through such a horrible experience. I have never had such a horrible trip combined with appalling service and complete lack of consideration and customer care. Upon my return I immediately contacted the airline to complain. I was told to e-mail as their web-site would not recognise their own flight number. I have still not had a response.",Detractor

Star Alliance Gold passengers can access the lounge for free-a nice feature. The flight departs on time. The A321 is in excellent shape, clean and well-kept, including IFE with dozens of programs at every seat even on short domestic flights. Nice leather seats. Seat pitch is reasonable.

"San Jose to Orlando via Fort Lauderdale. I've been fortunate enough to travel in 54 countries and been on over a hundred flights in the past ten years, mostly in developing countries. Whilst not my worst flight experience, Spirit Airlines is a very close second. I'm not going to address their obscene baggage fees because you can learn that in advance if you do your homework. First, they are one of the only airlines at the San Jose airport who does not include the departure tax in their fare, which is an additional $30. You won't discover this till arriving. This is effectively a deceptive hidden cost and again, they are the only airline that does this. Second, I was selected for additional screening, which is fine. I mean, we all have to take a it on that once and awhile, right? The problem is they selected me again when I arrived at the connecting airport. Security staff at both airports told me that the airline is the one that does the random selecting, they're just stuck enforcing it. The Spirit rep of course said it wasn't their fault for the obvious screw up and took no responsibility. Next, both flights were delayed despite clear weather. The second one by 4.5 hours, pushing a 11pm arrive to a 3:30am one. When I asked the rep how I was supposed to get home at 3:30am as no one could get me then, she told me that wasn't her problem. It's amazing to me how an airline can behave this way, shuck any responsibility for anything, provide no explanations and still stay in business. Fly anyone else.",Detractor

A350 clean and the effect was spacious, the choice to not install centre overhead bins makes for a roomy atmosphere.

"Dallas Ft Worth to Mexico City with Aeromexico. The flight itself was enjoyable. Good service and on time. However, arriving at Mexico City we had to deboard to a shuttle and be carried to the gate. On the return flight from Mexico City to DFW in the Mexico City terminal, it was complete chaos at the gate we were sent to. There were several flights leaving from the same gate number. It took us a few minutes to realize that this indeed was our gate and that we needed to get in line. Then we were sent downstairs to wait in another waiting room. Several flights from several airlines were called. The loudspeakers were not used to announce every flight, so many people were confused and did not hear their flight announced. We were very late leaving, probably at least 30-45 minutes. Some people who did not speak Spanish were completely lost as to what they needed to do. This is the second time we have flown to Mexico City and had the problem of not being able to board from the terminal directly to the plane, or having to deboard to the shuttle and then be taken to the terminal.

Johannesburg to London via Cairo - 20/21 August. Good fare check-in simple easy transfer at Cairo staff helpful and pleasant with special meal as ordered and ok. Egyptair is an airline of two halves depending on whether you get a new or old plane. Plane to London was new - 777 - with excellent seats and entertainment system - didn't feel cramped although completely full. Plane from JOburg to Cairo old and it showed. Parts in the toilets were kept together by duct tape and cable ties the overhead screens were not all working and entertainment offered dire. Also just as plane was taxing one of the toilets overflowed and it ran back through the plane during take off.

Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry.

First off our flight out of PDX was delayed 6+ hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Denver.

Once arriving in Seattle we were informed that we were actually waitlisted and did not have seats on their flight.

We requested they send us back to PDX and refund us our trip. After hours of phone calls and talking with the customer service desk they agreed to send us back to PDX. Worst part about this entire ordeal? They won't refund our $1,000 trip that was never had! I have spent the last 2 weeks on trying to get refunded and they only refunded us $150.

"  I had a trouble experience with American Airlines, not for the first time. I had a flight from SFO (San Francisco) to CMH (Columbus), with a connection at DFW (Dallas). The layover between two flights was about 1 and half of hour. The first flight had about 1 and half of hour delay, and technically I couldn't make it to the next flight.

When I got to DFW airport, my connecting flight was already left, and the next flight was in 12 hours (that is, the next morning). After realizing this, I decided to talk to AA Customer Service at DFW airport, and ask them for a place to spend the night. However, they told me your flight is not eligible for such an offer. So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something. However, their answer was: ""we are sorry and will try to make it better the next time"". Obviously, they really don't care, and they just want to make as much money as they can with the least quality of service or customer support!",Detractor
Flew MEL-AUH-MAN-AUH-SYD on EY461 and EY450 respectively earlier this month. Overall the Etihad experience was just OK. We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special. Abu Dhabi airport was transited with ease although we remained within Terminal 3 throughout. Flight delays were minor. If price was the sole determining factor I would recommend Etihad however on this overall experience I know there are much better options to be had elsewhere.,Passive

The New Castle (Wilmington DE) Airport was pretty much the only game in town during the March 3 snowstorm. Nearby Philadelphia Airport was all but closed. This was true for earlier snowstorms too. Our flight was delayed about an hour due to de-icing issues not the airline's fault. This little airport has all the charm of a Soviet-era military installation but I'll gladly forego shopping mall ambience for short lines free parking easy access and cheap flights.

"I attempted to purchase priority boarding, so that I had space for carry on. I got online the night before the flight but could not find that option. Called customer service and they advised that the system was having problems and to have the gate agent at time of check in do it for me. Gate agent said he could not do priority boarding, it had to be done online prior to check in. Went through security, called customer service and was advised that once you check in you cannot purchase priority boarding. I subsequently called American customer service again, spoke with four different people two of whom were supposed to be supervisors. All had different answers to why or how to buy priority boarding. Not one of them said the same thing. I spoke with American Airline service center person at Phoenix airport and this lady said she had been with American many years. She advised that American had recently changed many rules and procedures and no one knew what was going on. I will never fly American again, worst service in the business.",Detractor

"We flew LHR-HND via PEK, and then returned from NRT to LHR with a 72 hour transit visa stop in PEK. Despite the many negative reviews about Air China economy class, the fare was too good to travel with another airline. Overall, the experience wasn't too bad. We booked via an online travel agent, so were unable to select our seats online, but it wasn't a problem to contact the Air China customer service team and have our seat selections noted. The seat pitch was the same as most other economy class flights, although the foot rest on each seat was made for smaller people so it restricted leg room when raised. The crew didn't speak much English, but they knew enough to get by, and the in flight announcements were understandable. The inflight entertainment selection didn't have a lot of English language options, and was very limited overall when compared with airlines like Emirates. The food wasn't great, and the only wine available was a choice of red or white Great Wall Chinese wine, neither of which were nice. Overall, I'd fly Air China again if I wanted to travel to or via Beijing, but probably not again otherwise.",Passive

The food service was good, prices are reasonable and the staff friendly. But on the ground and in timeliness, the airline does not deliver. Four out of four flights were delayed, and on the outbound journey, our luggage arrived four days late. The b.famliy concept seems to be only a marketing stunt.

AKL-LAX-LHR in premium economy on Boeing 777-300 with the relatively new Spaceseats. I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,Promoter

Booked a cruise for the family in Alaska and we were hoping to fly Frontier from ATL to AK but when we got to the airport the airline said flight was delayed for 3 hours. Not a big deal but since we were connected through Denver we would miss our connecting flight. Also happens before not a big deal. The big deal was we would have to lay over in Denver for 2 days. We ended up being able to book a flight on Delta for twice as much and now the nightmare of trying to find out how to get linked up with our ship. Airline was very rude dismissive and well trained in saying sorry. Which is appropriate since this airline is very very sorry all around. Great to book if you don't care much about getting to your destination. Also don't be fooled by the prices. They charge you for both your checked and carry on luggage.

" Flew Singapore Airlines on my trip back from Japan on their A350-900, and the experience was really positive. In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers. Overall, I would recommend SQ, although the prices might sometimes be a little higher, it is worth as you are paying for what you get, and SQ is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service, matching ANA, who are known for their exceptional cabin service.",Promoter

Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat.

As far as the flight goes, it didn't differ much from my previous experiences with Air Canada. The food in economy class was horrible, save for the pretzel snacks and the chicken wrap they give out towards the end of the flight. The food in economy class is a major flaw of an otherwise very solid product, and I suggest Air Canada's partner Lufthansa to promptly inform passengers of any cancellations/delays.",Passive
 Phoenix to Cleveland. I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. You get up early to check in so you may have the luxury of choosing a seat and if you're traveling with loved ones being able to sit next to them. Well my partner and I got a B boarding pass 35 + 36. When we finally get to board we see these personal items of somebody's placed on two rows of seating. When my fiance and I go to sit down we are told those seats are being saved for someone else's family members. Obviously those family members did not get up to get a higher boarding number. When I asked the stewardess if that was allowed the stewardess replied we don't regulate the seating. Needless to say my fiance and I we're separated during a very long flight. Also we ordered drinks and the stewardesses sat in the back giggling and laughing with each other rather than doing their job we didn't get our drinks until we had to ask them not once but twice. I have been a faithful Southwest customer so has my mother two sisters aunt and many cousins I have told my whole family about my experience and we all agree to never fly Southwest again. Next time I need to fly I will pay the extra money and Fly Frontier Airlines that way I'll pay an extra couple of bucks but at least I know I'll be sitting with the person I'm traveling with and where I want to.

" London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I'm sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said â€œsorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change herâ€ she said â€œyou can't use these toilets you have to go backâ€ I explained the queue situation but she wouldn't budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it's the only pram we have and we couldn't drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience.",Detractor

My luggage did not arrive, which was not a surprise, with only 30mins layover. But it also did not arrive the next day and the day after, and so on. It arrived 4 days later when I had already left Cochin and I finally received it 1 day after my arrival back in London. The really annoying part however was that whenever I called the Etihad baggage helpline, I received mismatching information about the location of my suitcase. Overall the organisation of Etihad's baggage lost and found left room for a lot of improvement. I would not dissuade flying with Etihad, but be prepared for unpleasant surprises especially on flights via Abu Dhabi to India.

"Flew Air Canada rouge on both legs of a return trip to Toronto. I was worried about the reviews referring to cramped seating position so we purchased extra leg room seats in advance. The extra leg room seats made the flight very comfortable and so I have no complaints based on this being a budget airline offering. Without extra legroom seats my thoughts would have been different because the seat pitch in the standard seat looked very small indeed. On the return leg at the airport I tried to upgrade us to premium economy, Air Canada Rouge agents are a shambles. I was sent off to 3 different places before someone gave me a price that bore no resemblance to the price quoted on the internet. They couldn't even be sure if the price included or excluded the premium I had already paid for extra legroom seats.

LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation.

LGW-LIS on Dec 4 on an Airbus 320 in Economy - straight forward midday point to point flight. Flight was more or less on time slight delay into LIS not an issue. Web check-in was working fine and bag drop at Gatwick was friendly with no lines. Portuguese hospitality on board very pleasant friendly flight attendants. A salmon flatbread and drinks including beer and wine were served. FA's were present in the cabin throughout the flight and additional drinks were served on request. Bag out in LIS within minutes after arriving at the belt. Excellent product by TP with food drinks allocated seats and checked luggage included in the ticket price. Fare was also very competitive. Below GBP 60.- a one-way including ridiculous UK departure taxes. Unfortunately TP uses a bus gate for this flight at both Gatwick and Portela but that just a very minor inconvenience. The only negative was that TP uses a pay-per-entry lounge (No. 1 Lounge) for its frequent travelers. The lounge was hopelessly overcrowded.

"  Memphis to Colorado Springs. My wife was scheduled to fly out at 6 am on April 20, 2019. She received a text at 7 pm on April 19 stating that her flight had been cancelled. The reason she booked an early flight was so she could be in Colorado Springs shortly after our son gets off work. He's stationed at Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs. She was booked a flight 6 hours later than originally. Which puts her coming into Colorado Springs about the time he leaves for work. Not a lot of time for him to pick her up, get back on base, get her checked in at a room on base and then get to work. She called to see why her flight was cancelled and the CSR said it was due to maintenance. Not real happy with American Airlines and the short notice of the cancellation.",Detractor
"  After previously terrible experiences with this airline, I decided to give it another shot on this long haul route from Tokyo to Beirut, via Abu Dhabi. First impression was the absolutely enormous check-in line (which has been the case for every Etihad flight I've taken). It took an hour to get to the ticket counter. For some reason, this is always the case with Etihad-not sure if they are short staffed, have antiquated systems, or just simply do not care about the 95% of passengers who fly economy (of course, there were copious staff for business/first checkin who were doing nothing). Flight was on a new Dreamliner-seats were much tighter than other Dreamliners I've flown with other airlines, but not terrible. Great entertainment system. Mediocre staff, par for the course with Etihad, generally disinterested, no welcome, and terrible food.",Detractor
"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth. No problems with bags or leave time.",Passive

"BA362 6th June 2015. If this were the first flight I had taken with British Airways I would not be impressed. At check in there is a lack of professionalism. The customer does not come first even at the First Class check in. Staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in. The flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as ""ten minutes"". The aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. The inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in Club Class. Inflight entertainment system did not work. Whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. Inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. Upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers.",Detractor

"  Lisbon to Porto. They could learn a thing or two from low cost airlines. This was a very short 40min flight so I wasn't expecting much. Boarding times were a bit slow but we did depart and arrive on time. The plane was clean but no inflight entertainment provided and if you wanted to use the TAP app to download your free magazines, you can only if you have a frequent flyer card from TAP, if you use one from Lufthansa as I was (they are both star alliance members), you are out of luck. On the other end, it is nice of them to let me use whatever card I want from a Star Alliance company to have my miles credited. When they served the light snack, a simple pastel de BelÃ©m that was when everything came crashing down. Crew was rude, not caring how they served the passengers and almost threw the little cake into the trays, showing no care at all. The pastry was very hard, like uncooked or frozen and it tasted very bad! This is the national pastry! In the end, I talked to the captain and the head of the crew and they were nice and accepted my complaint but the guys actually serving the food did a very poor job, they had a childish like behaviour and seemed not very well trained for the job. I have had far better and caring service from the likes of Ryanair. Seat had an adequate amount of space. Not sure if I will fly with them again, not at least on this route.",Detractor
"We flew Air Canada rouge from Manchester to Orlando via Toronto in August. The first plane to Toronto was the Boeing 767 which was roomy enough in economy for us, I'm 6ft tall and the seat pitch was fine. The food was not the best, but certainly not the worst we've ever had. Staff were great, flight was problem free. As long as you go onboard knowing there is no in flight entertainment then you won't be disappointed. We took our own ipads etc and was fine. The route from Toronto to Orlando was a bit more cramped as we were on an A319 but it was only a 2hr 50 flight so for the price we paid was overall very happy with Air Canada rouge. We saved roughly Â£2500 by using Air Canada rouge indirect to Orlando over the bigger airlines like British Airways, Virgin etc so don't be put off by the bad reviews folks.",Promoter
"London Heathrow to Male via Abu Dhabi, good chauffeur service. Swift check in and fast track security. Great Etihad Airways lounge for first and business class customers. Very good flight to Abu Dhabi, attentive staff, Seats 7D/7E - my seat didn't fully recline to flat bed but I still managed a few hours sleep. The only thing is the area felt cramped, I'm 5 9 and my feet were squashed at the end. At Abu Dhabi we had a 2 hour stopover, the lounge is usually a nice place but it was crammed and not that pleasant! Second flight to Male again good service, the advantage of flying with Etihad is that you get fast track immigration vouchers avoiding the masses of people queuing to get through. Return flights again very good, although the Male business lounge is terrible. 4 hour stopover again in Abu Dhabi, the lounge quiet when we arrived but quickly became a scrum. A380 back to Heathrow, very turbulent for the first few hours but the plane handled it really well. Staff not so attentive but the plane just feels far roomier and more pleasant.

Never been screened before anywhere entering a country. May have to do with our origin. Return, a quick friendly check in at Milan but terrible long lines at security and passport control. No gate posted for the departure until 55 min before, so uneasy walking around not knowing which wing to proceed to. Long tarmac delay with no explanation from TK. In general their English annoucements are difficult to understand. A320 with a friendly crew, nice hot lunch and a nice bar service. This time a jetway in Istanbul, good shopping, but staff does not speak English. Is this an International airport? Then get personnel who can assist in English.

" On the 13.06.2019. I had my flight with Aer Lingus from Dublin to Lyon. I purchased two hour lounge access with it for EUR 30.00 as i had a good experience with Dublin Airport lounges in the past. This is the most pathetic excuse for an airport lounge i have ever seen and i been to a lot of them. The selection of drinks was limited. The place was dirty, there was no food. Next door, there is a far better lounge. After that my flight was delayed but nobody cared to communicate this to us. Then on the 16.06.2019. I could not view my boarding pass even though i had checked in the day before. I had to go to the counter to check in. We arrived a little later at the Dublin airport, where my luggage was misplaced. I spoke to the ground staff and reported luggage as missing. Asked the ground staff on how to proceed next, and was advised they will find my luggage within 72 hours. 72 hours later still no luggage but an SMS to call them. After speaking to an associate for 30 minutes and not getting anywhere i asked for a supervisor and was promised a supervisor call back in an hours time. 20.06 filled out lost baggage survey and called customer support as i did not receive promised supervisor call back. Was transfered to a supervisor who told that this will be resolved in 5 days. I asked him what will happen if not, he said that this wonÂ´t be the case. That if not found they will consider it lost! 21.06 in the late afternoon called them again. Spoke to another person telling me that they found my luggage and will deliver it to be today or tomorrow. 22.06 late afternoon called again as i havenÂ´t received my luggage. was advised, that they are still checking if this is my luggage. Then on the 25.06 i called again asking for an update. They said they still donÂ´t have one. I asked to talk to supervisor and was promised a supervisor call back within an hour. At 07:00 pm i called again insisting to speak to a supervisor and spoke to the most incompetent supervisor i have ever dealt. If a customer doesn't have their luggage for several days has spend hours on the phone you do not sigh at them. I also escalated to Aerlingus via fb while they were quick to respond, no body took accountability for the action. Nobody from the complaints department reached out to me to find out what happened.",Detractor

" Ho Chi Minh City to Kunming . I typed in the name correctly in their corresponding boxes and even on the ticket it shows the correct name but I got rejected at the ticket counter anyways because they claimed that in their data system the order of the name does not match the order on the passport. They basically said it doesn't matter if it's correct on the booking ticket because it's not correct in their data. This might be the scam from the airline or the agent (at that airport). How am I supposed to know what's going on with their system and what order they go by and how do I have control over that? Not sure what order they go with and if they keep in mind that half of the world has the order of the name as First - middle - Last and the other half of the world goes by the order of Last, Middle, First. They also did not allow name change (for a fee) and forced us to buy a new ticket. It is a cheap airline but the cost in the end was double the amount.

"In short, my flight was delayed over four hours due to mechanical problems, including with the plane's landing gear. The service from all members of staff we encountered was dismal. My flight was scheduled to depart Addis Ababa at 12.50am and arrive in Vienna at 5.50am. At Addis Ababa, we were directed to one entrance for security screening, whereupon staff closed the doors in our faces and directed us to a second entrance, the second entrance directed us back to the first entrance, we were then directed to a third entrance, where we waited a while, until being redirected to a fourth entrance. After boarding, we sat in the plane for forty five minutes before being told that the landing gear was broken. After another half an hour we were told that the air conditioning was also broken. The heat was sweltering. After a full hour and forty five minutes of this heat, the air stewardesses thought to bring us water. A stewardess handed the last cup to the passenger beside me, looked at me, then returned to the back of the plane. I pressed the call button three times over fifteen minutes. There were several other passengers also using their call buttons. Because I was sitting at the very back of the plane, I could hear the stewardesses chatting and laughing behind me. Finally I got out of my seat, walked past the stewardesses sitting around doing nothing, and poured myself a cup of water. In the end, the flight departed over four hours late, meaning that I missed connecting flights from Vienna to London and London to Montreal. In total I was in transit for 50 hours, rather than 38. I spoke to the airline's representative company, Celebi, in Vienna airport. Celebi provided me with accommodation and meals, but told me to call Ethiopian Airlines on the subject of further compensation. I called Ethiopian Airlines, and was told to talk to Austrian Airlines. I spoke to Austrian Airlines, who informed me that because the flight was operated by Ethiopian Airlines, I must speak to Ethiopian Airlines. I called Ethiopian Airlines again and it was confirmed to me that this was correct, but that I must contact Ethiopian Airlines via email.

The stewardess was unpleasant, not only ordered us back to our assigned seats but also made several others move, even just across the aisle. What was also interesting is I asked her name and she pulled her smock/jacket over where I could see her badge, reached down and tucked the badge completely out of reach. I moved one seat back so my daughter and I could each have separate rows and she made me move back â€œsomeone is sitting in that seatâ€ which of course was a lie as no one boarded.

"  I recently flew Aer Lingus from Edinburgh to Chicago, changing flights in Dublin. The scheduled layover was 2 hours, but the originating flight from Edinburgh was more than 45 minutes late leaving the gate. When I realized how little time I was going to have to make my connecting flight from Dublin to Chicago I asked a member of the ground crew at the boarding gate desk in Edinburgh for assistance in changing flights in Dublin. My right arm was in a sling due to a broken shoulder and I was walking with a walking stick, carrying a purse and pulling a rolling backpack. The boarding gate attendant told me I would have plenty of time and no problems and refused to procure any assistance for me. Long story short, I almost fell on one of the many escalators that I had to use in the Dublin airport (it is pretty challenging to get on and off an escalator while pulling and carrying the aforementioned articles with one good arm and the other arm in a sling) and I barely made the flight to Chicago. At no time during my frantic transfer through the Dublin airport, although I was clearly handicapped, did any member of the Aer Lingus ground crew offer any assistance. In fact, I don't remember any opportunities to ask any ground crew for assistance (after the initial refusal from the boarding attendant) as ground crew were largely non-existent. The flights themselves were pretty pleasant and I commend the pilots for smooth takeoffs and landings and flights. In-flight food was decent and flight attendants were businesslike and efficient. Don't use this airline if you need any assistance within the airport. They are clueless. I cannot give them a rating any higher than 2 because the lack of requested help within the airport almost caused me to further injure my shoulder.",Detractor

When I boarded I didn't find a toothbrush set on my seat which is very disappointing on an overnight flight. The legroom was amazing, and that's what you expect when flying Main Cabin Extra.

The IFE was good with a huge range of music, many TV shows, and a adequate music on- demand radio choice. The power outlets were universal and it charged fast unlike the USB plug of the IFE. The service was good and kind, provided 3 drinks but you can ask them anytime to give you another one. The meal (I chose pasta) was pretty good, and came with a salad with dressing, a bun, crackers, cheddar, butter and a brownie. The breakfast was a fat free strawberry yougurt, a little bag of cereal for the yogurt, a cranberry snack and a flat over-processed muffin.

" Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn't work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

Check in agent was friendly and efficient. No business agent per say as advertised. Lounge in T2 even though its new was over crowded. If flydubai expects to operate a dedicated business class in all its flights in the future they will have a problem as the lounge area is very small - both the bar and buffet area in addition to this since its a marhaba lounge most of the credit cards guests are also welcomed. Boarding was with economy class onboard a dedicated crew member who was efficient and friendly. Seat good for short hops better than European low cost business class who block the middle seat.

"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.",Passive
"Onboard Royal Air Maroc flight AT572 this Sunday, November 15th from Casablanca to Tunis. They made us walk from the terminal to the plane. The plane is dirty.

" Used to be a great airline, been flying Southwest since 1989 but what a disappointment. Lied about the reason for the delay, no accommodation for rescheduling, didn't post the new departure time once we got to Chicago. Didn't honor the fees we paid for early boarding. Just a bad day made worse by bad attitudes. Sorry Southwest I will book elsewhere in the future",Detractor

" Rio de Janeiro to Frankfurt. Definitely below expectations. I had a seat on the upper deck. No single seats, the seats were too narrow to sleep with comfort. The light was not adjusted, no dividers for privacy. The cabin was hot and filled with the toilet smell. Flight attendants were nice but too formal and hardly available during the flight. On the good side, the movie selection and noise cancelling headphones were quite ok. The lounge in Rio is fantastic.",Detractor
HKG to Newark premium economy cabin showed as full was actually quiet. Really all you get is a better seat and more space. Bathroom is actually quite a way back in economy.

On time pilot updated regularly and all in all much better than other option United.

" Hartford to Dublin, I booked this August 2018 flight for my honeymoon back in December. When I went to go through my itinerary for my entire trip one last time my flight was cancelled! I received no notice of this I had already been charged and my fiancÃ© and I spent over 10 hours on hold starting Friday afternoon and did not get in touch with someone until Sunday morning who said no one could help us over the phone it had to be done through email! At this point we were in a straight panic and had to rebook so now we have paid twice for our honeymoon and frankly are too frustrated to even be excited about it. Still have not received any response from numerous emails sent and numerous claims submitted through their website. Not to mention I booked directly with Aer Lingus thinking that would put in the most secure position for my honeymoon travel plans!!!",Detractor
Edinburgh to Doha flight QR 28 on 24th January 2015. First time I've flown with Qatar Airways. I would not hesitate in recommending them. I believe this is the best economy class flight I have been on. Spacious seating tasty food and friendly attentive staff. I have experience of long haul flights where the cabin crew get the service out of the way as quickly as possible and then disappear behind a curtain for the rest of the flight. This was not like that at all. They were helpful throughout the flight. I was very impressed.,Promoter
" Chicago to La Guardia. I've been a loyal southwest customer for several years now, flying with them over 30 flights. They're delays and cancellations are worse than other airlines, but I stick with them due to the no change fees. On the day before my wedding shower, they abruptly cancelled my flight via text. I scrambled to find another flight. I called, and they said it was due to maintenance and put me on a flight the following day, which wasn't an option, so I paid an exuberant amount for a different airline, which took off within an hour of the cancelled flight (so not weather related). I rarely call for anything, even when I have severe delays due to scheduled maintenance or disorganization on southwests behalf, but this was especially frustrating so I called. The man on the phone was so condescending. He told me it was due to air traffic control and kept repeating himself when I asked for more details and for understanding. He kept interrupting me and yelled at me. He wouldn't allow me to speak to a supervisor but then said his boss would get him in trouble for helping me out. He was so harsh and given my lack of sleep due to southwest delays, I broke into tears. Customer service has gone down, and I plan on spending my points and running as far as I can from Southwest. So disorganized and unable to admit or explain their actions.",Detractor

Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.,Detractor

"  Hamburg to Amsterdam. I was very dissapointed with the way I was treated by the crew, specially by a lady from the cabin crew. The flight was delayed, which can happen. But how hard is it to give the people waiting in line a heads up? Then by entering the plane it was hard for the crew to great their customers. I greeted them in their language and asked if there maybe was any room for my suitcase (which was the size it was allowed to be). The answer was no. I asked what I was supposed to do. She said in a very unpolite way that it could be packed downstairs. I was a little bit shocked by the impoliteness of the crew. If you become a cabin crew I think one of the first things you learn is to be polite! It was not my fault that the flight was delayed.",Detractor
"  London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro. 45 minute delay on the tarmac. Air conditioning wasn't working during delay - would only work once engines were on. The cabin was therefore unbearably hot. The foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. This is a 12 hour flight and I don't think this is acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight. In flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. British Airways is not a budget airline. In fact airlines currently rated lower than BA in the Top 100 airlines (eg Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still provide complimentary on board snacks. There were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. Once, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. How rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no fruit. What is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike). This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting. I'd had no choice in your menu, and what was served up was unpalatable. I have to take medication that needs to be taken with food - I had no choice but to purchase food on board. An additional charge on an already expensive flight is a 'hard pill to swallow'.",Detractor

Flew Perth to Doha to Manchester return which I do a few times a year. The planes where all very clean we flew an A330 and B777. The seat quality was one of the best I have had. The biggest let down for me and why I will not be using Qatar again was because I am an emerald one world flyer I was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served I was asked again as my preference was no longer available. I explained I had made a previous order being an emerald member. This was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges.

BOG-SCL-BOG. Avianca's new business class is bad. I used to be a fan of Avianca. It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,Detractor
"We were a bit wary given negative reviews, but after two flights with Spirit our experience was fairly positive. The website booking process is transparent in terms of added charges - hold baggage, carry on baggage, printing boarding cards at the airport, etc. There is a premium on leg room on the aircraft but again the website is clear on this and despite being 6'3"", I had no difficulty on short haul flights. A longer flight might be a bit more uncomfortable. During check-in a fairly pragmatic approach was taken to the weight of bags - as long as they weren't well over the allowed limit, there was no excess charge. Both of our flights arrived on schedule. Overall, I'd have no hesitation in travelling with Spirit again.",Passive

" I am writing this letter in utter disgust and frustration. I was travelling on A2657 from Orlando to Miami on 14/1/18 with what was to be a connecting flight to Antigua on A2405. Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American. I had to pay an additional $15 for proper food. Another Issue was the shuttle that was to take me to the hotel had me waiting 2 hours, by this time I had given up. Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about. I was told that I would be occupying 12A. I am awaiting a reward for that First class ticket that I purchased.",Detractor
"  Birmingham to Cape Town via Istanbul and Durban. BHX to IST a comfortable B737-800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew weren't very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasn't very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330-300, much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT, including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities (toothbrush, socks.etc) given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPT-IST via Durban on an A330-300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737-800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall, not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English.",Detractor

This is the second time I have flown Cathay Pacific and both times have received unfriendly service. When I went to the bathroom while the seat belt sign was on, I was told to ""go sit down"" like a child being scolded, even though there is no turbulence and at least 4 other customers had gone to the bathroom immediately before me with no hassle. I had to insist that I had to use the toilet before the flight attendant would let me pass. The service, by contrast, on my flight in the other direction via Singapore Airlines was perfection, the reason why they are consistently at the top of the list.

" One of the worst Customer service. I am scheduled to travel from Detroit to Chennai via Newark. My initial flight from Detroit was at 4:45 which was delayed and hence i was rescheduled in another flight at 5:50 pm. I boarded the flight on time, but United Airlines made me to sit inside the flight for 3 hours without taking off and took off at 8:30 pm to Newark, but they diverted to Washing DC and reached DC at 10:45 pm. I missed my connection from Newark which was scheduled to be 8:50 pm. When i landed in Washington DC, i contacted the United Representative who asked me to go Newark in the same flight which is going back to Newark and ask the Representative over there. So i have to wait to go to Newark to ask about my options. In the meantime, United didnt offer any food or water as it is 11 pm and none of the shops are open at DC and I didnt have any food after lunch. I boarded the flight in DC to Newark at 11:30 pm and again we were made to sit inside the airplane for another 2 hours before take off and reached Newark at 3:30 am (next day). I have to wait in line for 3 hours to speak to United Airline customer representative and took more than one hour to reschedule to another flight which i have to tell them what flights are available by looking from my personal phone. By the time i completed the process, it is 7:30 am and my reschedule flight is at 2:15 pm from Newark. I had 7 hours and United Airlines said wait in the airport to take the next flight which is through Air India. United never offered any accommodations or food and never ever thought about their customer. I waited in the airport and reached India the next day, but found out my bag didnt reach. When i contacted Air India which was the carrier which brought me to India, AirIndia mentioned that United Airlines never handed over the bags to them. Its been 2 days after i reach and yet to receive my bags and AirIndia told me United is yet to give the bags. Don't travel through United Airlines, as this is my second worst experience with United Airlines. Exactly three years ago, i flew through United from Washington DC to Frankfurt and United made to sit in the flight for 6 hours without taking off and asked us to get out of the flight after 6 hours of delay stating they have technical issues. At that time, i decided never to take United, but this time Lufthansa asked me to take United as part of their alliance as Lufthansa flight are booked for certain dates. I was assuming that United Airlines would have changed in the last three years and would be better. To my assumption, they have changed, but worse than the previous time. Atleast last time when the issue happened, United provided accommodations and food, but this time they didn't care about any of the customers and didn't even worry about anything about their customer.

From what the staff told me, the bags were unloaded from the airplane but no one was there to deliver them to the baggage claim area. We were all standing around waiting for our bags and it took a very long time for the staff to figure out what happened. Finally I got my bag and was given a ticket for some bonus miles, but the agent did not tell me that I only had 3 days to claim them. I waited until I returned home a week later, and by then it was too late to get the miles. The flight was expensive and uncomfortable The 6:40 am departure time was too early.

" Manila to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. The flight crews are more attentive and smiling in providing quality service to passengers. A big change from past experiences. I had a combination flight of Business (Manila to Abu Dhabi) then Economy (Abu Dhabi to Brussels). In both flights, service was almost impeccable. There was also an impressive and much-welcomed amelioration in the lounge for Gold members who can now access more exclusive lounges: if flying from Terminal 1, it is now the one beside the Al Reem, which is much cosier than the latter and the food choices are a plenty. If flying from Terminal 3, Gold members are allowed at the Business Class Lounge. Before, I would only have access to this lounge when I flew business. Now, on economy flights, Gold members are welcomed here. The only area that still need improvements are the ground crews in Brussels. You hardly find anyone friendly here in the past but maybe now, I probably was just unlucky to be attended by someone new. Nothing of what I requested was arranged and he was not aware of the protocol for Etihad frequent flyer members.

Only real down size is that if you were to fly regularly the entertainment content is very limited by Thales. I am giving a 5 on this as my return was a cash upgrade to business class - this was in my view a waste of money - staff were not engaged - service was very very sloppy. Service commenced with one drink after take off then nothing for 2.5 hours - no refill , no checks. Food was much better in economy - starter appeared, no wine, no bread - waited and waited, nothing gave up. Bread and wine appeared well after Starter finished. Crew did not know which wines were which - beef main course was the worst I have ever had any where. Rock hard, inedible - sent it back to be told nothing else available - Business class?

First and last flight I will take with them. Had flown London-Havana via Amsterdam with no problem with KLM. Return flight with AF - not so. Firstly flight to Paris was cancelled. Received a text about 16 hrs before flight despite them knowing 3 days in advance. Eventually another plane was chartered via Air Caraibes. We ended up leaving 3 hrs later and arriving in CDG after we were originally due to be in London. In Cuba we were told (rudely) we had been booked onto a flight with BA that was leaving at 9pm meaning we arrived in London 9 hrs after we were due to be there with a 7 hr wait in CDG. Told to get boarding pass from AF desk in Paris. Got there to find 4 staff going at snails pace (again rudely) whilst 300 irate and upset passengers waited to get their ongoing passes. We were almost at the front yet waited 70 mins to be told we had to go to the BA desk 2 terminals away. They didn't actually speak to me by the way preferring to speak to my husband. Got to the BA desk who after trying to get a pass for 2 hrs said AF needed to release the booking. My husband ran back and forth between terminals 2a and 2e 3 times before AF would listen to him and eventually conceded that it was their fault. Did we get any apology? No. I will never fly with them again.,Detractor
  Impressive dinner service in economy. Flew short trip Adelaide to Melbourne in the evening. The cabin crew were more mature then a lot of other airlines and while they did not look like supermodels they exuded experienced and confidence that made an impact. They must enjoy their job otherwise why were they doing it for so long. The experience made a big difference compared to the younger crew we often get on airlines. I was expecting a bag of peanuts on such a short hop (as we had on another airline coming over) but instead they rolled out dinner. The Qantas bigger economy meals were noticeably large and I was hungry and as I was not getting home until 10.30pm I was very happy to actually have a satisfying meal - plus red wine and just when i was wishing for something sweet along came a chocolate. The Flight attendant later came and gave me a handful of extra chocolates as a sudden surprise gift. They are a little more expensive than a budget airline but there is a big difference and I would pay an extra few dollars for this kind of service. They are obviously trying hard to give a great service and I was surprised and impressed.,Promoter
We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues.

We settled in for a meal, and as we were eating, began to get notifications about an earlier boarding time, so we started to board the plane almost minimizing the original delay. However, it is here that things took a turn for the worse. Upon scanning passes and going into the air bridge, we were stopped. We held for 15-20 minutes before finally someone showed up to tell us that there was no crew for the flight. The worst part is that we could not go back the way we came because of security procedures regarding exit-Schengen flights. So we proceeded to wait another 15 minutes in the hot/glass air bridge with no AC. When we asked for water, we were refused and the airline employee looked shocked that we even asked. In the end, we left with the original 2-hour delay. When contacting the airline for sympathy compensation for the gross mistreatment, they continue to deny me and claim that it doesn't fall under EC 261. They're right, except I never requested EC 261. I asked for compensation for the mistreatment, which they continue to hide from. The customer service deserves no stars, because they are either not reading, or they are not willing to compensate flyers and they choose to hide it by saying other things that don't relate to you in order to tire you out and make you stop trying. It's a cheap airline, don't expect the employees to care about their job!",Detractor
"  London Heathrow to Copenhagen with SAS Scandinavian. Sound flight. Departed and arrived on time, FAs friendly and efficient and baggage arrived quickly. Only annoyance was my boarding card didn't recognise my TK Star Alliance Gold status - to be fair I think this is a wider issue which is not unique to SAS - which led to slight delays at fast track and lounge access. The flight was only Â£65 one way so no complaints.",Promoter
" Flew Doha to Goa. Great airline, with a great service. Truly amazed by the attention to detail.

"  London to Melbourne via Dubai. A kiwi giving qudos to the Aussies, excellent on QF10 both legs. The staff and service were great, the same on QF9 going the other way.

I fly about 5-12 times a year so it's not a lot but it's not a little either. I've done international and many within the USA. I have never flown with AA but I will from now on. I usually only fly us air but I'm on a flight from CLT to Dallas/Ft. Worth and it was the most comfortable short distance flight I have taken to date. Other competitors don't even come close. (I'm comparing only to those flights within the USA and mid-size) the seats were comfortable the staff nice and each seat has a TV in front of it. Well done for changing my mind!,Promoter
"London to Sydney via Singapore in business class. I am English born and have always had an affinity with British Airways. I had not flown with them for a while and booked business class seats for my wife and I, and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole experience and will not be trying them again. They are so far behind other airlines - you expect in business class to feel just a bit special, but as reviewed earlier you do not get any special service. A lousy check in, herded along with the rest on boarding, a lousy inflight toiletry bag. As for the food, just awful on both legs to Sydney. The crew on the London to Singapore were unengaging, at least the 2nd leg crew were better. The bad news is that I still have the return leg to LHR with them.",Detractor
Manchester to Christchurch via Dubai - 773ER out in Economy and had the best Economy food we have had on a plane. We are frequent flyers and this was excellent coupled with great crews and their entertainment system made a great flight.

"  Frontier cancelled my Orlando to San Diego flight after boarding while trying to get to the runway. The airport has a 11:30 pm to 6:30 am curfew not allowing any departure flights during this time. The flight was on schedule to depart at 10:57 pm. At 11:32 pm, the plane only made it to some part of the runway only to announce the flight was canceled due to curfew and only a $10 breakfast voucher with no accommodation or compensation were to be offered. The next available flight would be at 1:30 pm. Most of us had to spend the night at the airport. There was no available rooms in the city. Staff was rude, inhumane and arrogant. On top of all, I had to spend $80 extra to check in my one piece of luggage and one carry on. Seats are very uncomfortable with no amenities for 5 hour long flight. Have never experienced this type of service anyware. Never again will I fly Frontier.",Detractor
We flew with BA on 6th February to Goa - had three flights in all starting at Manchester. On our outbound journey we were upgraded to Premium Economy which was fantastic! Very comfortable food was much nicer. On our way back we were in economy. As a family of 4 we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. Our youngest was awfully sick I think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. Bless the steward who cleaned it up. However we were sat for 10 hours with the after effects! Nothing anyone could have done however. Staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. Would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. Not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined there's little room. The passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my TV screen - I had to keep moving them off. Just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!,Passive
"Whilst I was courting BA on this route something magical happened to cabin crew of TAM Brazil. This was my second trip with Latam this year and the staff attitude could not have been friendlier and more helpful. No more standing back and letting passengers fight for locker space or argue about mistaken seat numbers. Crew welcomed and assisted passengers and remined courteous and friendly during what is still limited contacts with passengers. The old habit of early boarding and a fast pace meal service remains along with the crew exodous to the beverage bar for most of the flight. The B777 which doesnt seem to have been on this route so long is now getting tired. Dinner was a decent offering in both directions and although there is not a designated Bar service as such I managed a couple of glasses of half decent red. The small goodie bag of socks pen and toothbrush are no more and not a snack to be seen during the 11 hour flight. Film selections not too up to date but I selected two each way. All in all, boarded, flew and got off rather like an extended coach trip. Not too bad an option in the light of pretty ordinary airlines on the London - Latin America route.",Passive
"Chicago to Austin with United and they gave away my ""confirmed"" window seat, and stuck me in middle for an almost 3 hour flight. Person at gate counter was beyond rude and flat lied to me about assigning a window seat to another economy passenger right in front of me. I was the 2nd person at gate, a full hour before flight and was told just because my reservation had an assigned seat, that it wasn't guaranteed. (What is the point of making advance reservations?) Some airlines seem to have forgotton about customer service and the fact our money keeps them in business. I will not fly with them again.",Detractor
"  Horrible airline. Midflight the captain said a single sentence â€œWe can't land in London, we are turning back around to Amsterdam.â€ This was followed by complete radio silence after we flew back, save for some automated messages (put on your seatbelts, etc). After we landed, there was zero communication on what would happen for hours. Finally, after three hours had passed, they said they were cancelling the flight and moving it to the next morning. After that, we tried to get a hotel for the night, but for hours they were not cooperating and refusing to offer us a place to stay (at midnight already, while there were many people with children present). After hours of arguing and shouting people finally got hotels, and we had to wait for the flight the next morning, except when this flight was supposed to happen was very unclear. They stated 8am, but the e-ticket and website said 10am. I suppose the truth is always in the middle, because the flight left at 9am! Amazing. Horrible airline, horrible communication. Do not use it.",Detractor
"A very pleasant experience apart from the so called fast track lane that took 20 minutes. The business class lounge was very nice with a great choice of drinks and snacks for early morning departure. As a regular on the Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh route it was a breath of fresh air to have the option of a full service airline and Oneworld member. The business class seats are the same as economy class on the A320 but the middle seat blocked off worked for me, and the fare paid was very similar to easyJet flexi rates. Excellent service from take-off to landing.",Promoter
"  I used Norwegian from London to Helsinki and return. Both my flights were delayed an hour. No explanation and no apologies and nothing. I missed my train from the airport to the city centre and had to purchase a new ticket.

I am not sure if I will use them again.",Passive
" Manchester to Seoul via Munich. Return leg, with stop over in Munich for 4 days. Man to Munich was uneventful, standard A321, Snack was OK, seating as per economy with spare seat in middle empty. Service was ok. Munich to ICN on 8 month old A350, flight was on time. Seating the same as 747-400. Amenities kit poor. Food was stone cold, choice of wines limited to two red and two white. My choice of main was not available (or none left ). Flight was 90% full. Kids meal was OK as was amenity pack for kids. Service was okay, WiFi poor.",Passive
Travelled from SIN-HKG and back. Check-in counter waiting time really efficient at Hong Kong Airport Express station and Singapore is really efficient. Aboard flight good movies and TV shows shown on StudioCX and the food was very fresh and tasty. Good flight attendant service with the newest economy class. Clean cabin and toilet and quiet flying experience on Airbus A330-300. I think CX should improve on the array of movies and TV shows as they are fewer than other airlines. but so far I am satisfied on both flights.,Promoter
"Flew from Bilbao to London Gatwick. Vueling is a low-cost airline and generally you get what you pay for: The queues are long and you are packed into a plane where the only option is expensive junk food. Having said that, the staff were pleasant and professional and the plane was fine. My objection is that I ended up with Vueling by booking a British Airways ticket for an Iberia codeshare that was operated by Vueling. It was a classic bait-and-switch. There was no priority check in for executive club members and I was refused entry to the lounge at Bilbao, being told that BA didn't grant access for Vueling passengers. As both airlines are owned by the same company, IAG, this is a little annoying.",Passive
"Lufthansa seems to fill their planes easily: full flights Helsinki to Dresden via Munich on a Thursday evening (A319/CRJ900) and similarly full on the return via Frankfurt on a Monday afternoon (A319/A321). Onboard the service was solid Lufthansa quality on all sectors with competent crews plus sandwiches and drinks as usual, but the fact that we were bussed from and to aircraft at Munich and Frankfurt made the transfers quite tedious. The highlight was the plane change at FRA where we arrived at around gates A1-A2 by bus, walked all the way to gate A69 in the newest terminal extension (T1) and realized that we're bussed back to around gates A1-A2 where the A321 to Helsinki was waiting for us. 9/10 for their solid performance and 4/10 for the transfer arrangements between flights, it was so hot and unpleasant in the buses.",Passive
"A few firsts for me on this Qatar Airways trip to Bangkok - the A380, the Boeing 787 plus the new Doha airport. Whole trip was a masterclass on flying from check in and facilities at London Heathrow T4, amazing A380 the new airport at Doha and fasttrack at Bangkok. The crews were very helpful and friendly (in the A380 bar they really excelled), food and wine so enjoyable that seconds were offered if available! If there was any downside it was the Boeing 787 - after the space of the A380 it felt noisy, the blinds didn't keep the setting sun out, and something of a throwback to narrow bodied longhaul aircraft but without the romance - I am old enough to remember 707s and the DC8s. All in all a perfect journey and naturally will be booking again",Promoter

 Las Vegas to Denver. Horrible business model and terrible customer service from ground crews to flight crews. You will see the rates thinking Frontier offers great deals until you actually check in.

MS702 from Amman Jordan to Cairo with connecting flight MS995 from Cairo to Toronto Pearson. The flight attendants were extremely undutiful. The plane was very old and uncomfortable.

Staff checking tickets at the gates were rude.,Detractor
"After flying Ryanair for the past 7 years, I found a cheap fare for Aer Lingus, I didn't hesitate to book the flag-carrier for my return leg. Boarding was a shambles to be blunt about it, like cows walking into a barn, just banging into each other and no order of a queue. This was due to handling agents at Venice and not EI crew. The departure was speedy and comfortable, the crew were very smily and friendly upon boarding. The captain have numerous updates throughout the flight about delays and our ETA. Meal service was excellent. Although slow, this didn't matter on the 3 hour flight. The food was so fresh. I could tell the scone was baked recently and the bread on my sandwich was so soft. The best inflight food I've head in a while to be honest. Although it's not free, it is reasonably priced. The approach was very quick and we landed 10 minutes ahead of schedule after departing 20 minutes late which was nice. De boarding was nice and a big farewell from the smiley crew. A very enjoyable flight.",Promoter
Another Bangkok- Koh Samui return trip. Good service all around quick check in good lounge with nice snack. ATR 72 aircraft for outgoing flight is really worn out and cramped but FA make up for it. A small surprise souvenir in the seat pocket - key ring from Sony inflight snack tasty. Return flight on International configuration A319 as it is a part of Hong Kong - Koh Samui - Bangkok. New aircraft comfortable seat with best seat pitch comparing to their other aircraft. Both flights punctual.,Promoter
Having been to the Far East a couple of times a year for the last 15 years I thought I would try Cathay Pacific. What a dreadful experience. The crew seemed young and inexperienced. Food was atrocious. Had a beef dish which I left. Breakfast was no better. It was a 13 hour flight. Dinner served in the first 2 hours then nothing for a further 10 hrs. When breakfast did cone only the fruit and yoghurt were edible. Complained about the same issue on the outward trip. Received a response apologising for the late flight an apparently poor weather. My flight was not late and nor was there bad weather. Seems the response was just copy and pasted from other complaints. Baggage allowance was a miserly 20k. Etihad and Emirates give 30k. Will certainly never use them again.,Detractor
"CAI-DXB, first leg of CAI-MEL with Qantas but this leg operated by Emirates. Check-in at CAI crowded but done professionally. On-time departure. Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch. Unfortunately at DXB aircraft was parked ages away from the terminal, which meant a 20 min bus ride. Overall, a pretty good experience but still issues with making the Qantas-Emirates interaction feel seamless, especially at check-in and transit.",Passive
" Houston to Istanbul. Very poor staff interaction, in both the aircraft and Istanbul airport, it's quite unenjoyable to be in such hostile environment.

I believe they used to be the best airlines in Europe, now I am confident to say they are the worst in Europe.",Detractor
EWR-PVG on a 777-200. Economy Plus exit window seat. Was able to get this seat without paying for it due to a bug in the online seat map (otherwise it would be an extra $192). Overall it was a satisfying flight given I only paid a little above 600 dollars for this non-stop flight which would usually be over 900. The food was standard but not very adequate. There were friendly flight attendants but some were very rude and indifferent. Entertainment was ok but the system was sluggish. The headset did not work but I was able to use my own earphones. Lavatories were not very well maintained and I didn't see any flight attendant clean it during the entire flight. However all these negative aspects were overpowered by the price and the free exit window seat. Would definitely fly them again.,Passive
"  AC 1967 on 8th August 2017: Flight left and arrived on time even though extremely slow and time consuming passport control just prior to entering boarding area. Seat pitch in Premium Rouge generous but recline not sufficient. Excellent meal service.

On a side-note: they kept the lavatory in front of the Premium Rouge cabin immaculate. Entertainment system via supplied I pad was good but personally missed the possibility of loading the usual ""flight-path"" feature.

I took Vueling from Barcelona to Paris and back. I was concerned after reading negative reviews but my experience was completely positive. Check in was smooth and fast.

I flew from Vienna to Athens and back on a business trip and was once again astonished and very disappointed with Austrian - The flight to Athens had a delay of over 2 hours and we just sat there in our seats in the plane which was getting overly uncomfortable. No drinks or food were offered during that time either. When asking the cabin crew for help they'd just ignore me in a very rude manner. After take-off they gave us a choice of an apple or solettis (mini pretzels) which was way below expectations and not even close to enough on a 2-hour flight although they offered a decent variety of drinks. The seats were very uncomfortable on both flights - Both were operated by an A320 aircraft and both flights were empty (only around 30 passengers on each flight). The flight back also got delayed although it was a shorter delay. Once again bad service rude and unpleasant flight crew and flying with Aegean would have cost me a lot less and I would have received far better service.,Detractor

The seat/bed is spacious, stylish and comfortable. The selection of beverages and food average and the service on this flight, appalling. The staff made flying business feel like the new economy. They do not make eye contact, answer the call bell, return with requests (even if you ask four times at twenty minute intervals) or serve you breakfast if you ask not to be woken for it (regardless of your slumber status). They do: congregate in the guest onboard bar/lounge talking loudly in a manner that could lead you to believe they were having their own cocktail party.",Passive
LHR-IAD-LHR 29/9 and return 13/10. We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380 and B777 both fitted with the revamped World Traveller Plus - far more comfortable than the old style WTP with an infinitely better IFE system. So guess how pleased I was when BA changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit B747's with the old style WTP. The 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good grief BA can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? The good points: both flights were on time and the FA's were OK. That's it. This would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. This is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No other major airline that I regularly use does this - not even small ones like Bangkok Airlines or United Express. It is shameful - even our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline. I recommend BA but with enormous reservations - try to book on the B777 or A380 and if you don't need to choose your seat before check in you'll be OK.,Passive
Flew business class with my wife from BHX to IST. Comfortable enough on both legs but late departures on each flight. Cabin crew were good to excellent though service rather grudging and not as attentive as my experiences with Emirates. Aircraft cabin littered on both legs.

Biggest problems on return leg was hopelessly disorganised ground staff: chaotic hectic and not at all relaxed or smooth as one would expect in business class.,Passive
Flew from Toronto to Rome and back. Boarding in Toronto was chaotic there was no process to board back of the plane first then middle then front. It was a free-for all. Staff remained at back of plane for entire flight except when serving beverages then meals. No water or snacks in between meals. The planes were old - in fact had ashtrays in the arm rests. TV's were the old fashioned shared versions. Movie on the way over was pathetic. One of two movies on way back was good. Cold air was blowing the entire time from Rome to Toronto with no way to adjust air flow. I will not fly Alitalia again.,Detractor

Flew JFK-MCO on Aug 28 in Economy Comfort. Aircraft ok massive delay on taxi way due to congestion.

Old tired aircraft with video screens fixed to ceiling. Crew inserting VHS tapes for IFE. Cabin smelt dirty carpet dirty everything. Time to retire the 757 fleet.

Norwegian from Stockholm Arlanda to Oakland on June 28th with Premium Class. Arlanda check-in for Norwegian Airlines was disorganized and overcrowded. There was no Premium check-in line at Stockholm airport as there was at Oakland airport. Baggage self check-in was not available for passengers traveling to the U.S but this was not clearly displayed so I wasted 30 minutes waiting in line for self-check only to have to stand in the much longer line with ground crew afterwards. Dreamliner Boeing 787 is a comfortable quiet and well-designed aircraft and hopefully they can master the technical issues that seem to come up more often than on other Boeing aircraft. Friendly Thai crew food was good but only one wine or beer beverage (except for small cognac with coffee) any cocktails and snacks after were extra (had some issues with sliding the credit card for payment). Entertainment just OK with only a few new movies and mostly re-runs. I would not expect Business Class perks but overall a good value given the non-stop flight and Premium Class costing around $1000 less than competing airlines' Business Class.,Passive

I just found out that I will need to fly straight to Melbourne from Bali for work reasons and won't have time to fly home to Perth.

I would understand the expectation to pay some kind of a fee for updating the flight destination, but the fact that they don't even offer it as an option is an extreme inconvenience. Air Asia prevents you from changing flights is to force you into paying for an entirely new flight.

"Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned. The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE. It's archaic and that's being polite. Fuzzy, small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles, they're illegible.",Detractor

When the error has been there for days, it should be possible to handle it at the airport. Of course not, they dont acknowledge the error or their responsibility for having working webpage functions, when their whole service is surrounded on customers handling ordering etc. Customer service wont pay me back the airport fee of course, and only repeats its my own responsibility. It's simply amazing to treat customers like this. What planet was Wizz founded on? Do they save money on angry customers?",Detractor
"We purchased first class seats to fly New York to Buenos Aires return.

AA started to go around giving us excuses, and I was able to obtain a partial refund when checking in at JFK. AA oversold the returning flight in the business class. I called customer service and I was transferred to the ""resolution department"". Half an hour on the phone with zero assistance. We went to the airport knowing that AA took away our seats selection. The line for check in and the area was horrible (First Class). We got the boarding pass with no seats assigned and no boarding gate provided. We finally got our seats, 10 minutes prior to boarding in a nasty boarding area with no AC in summer time. The new Boeing 777 did not have the promoted walk in bar and the windows that are supposed to provided with privacy in the middle seats did not work - I'm still waiting to get the full refund between first class paid, toward business class provided with a horrible travel experience. Mails were sent with no response at all. AA should stop painting old airplanes and spending money in advertising, and provide better service and maintenance in the airplanes.",Detractor
SFO-NRT NRT-MNL. Check-in at SFO was efficient and friendly which was a good start for the trip. Service on board was efficient friendly and warm. This is perhaps ANA's strong suit although it may just be a cultural thing for Japan but the cabin crew were beyond amazing. Every service call was answered and every request was honored. Their professionalism is excellent and each interaction was followed by a bow and a thank you even though they are the one doing you a favor. However the IFE seat comfort and food was average. 77W was configured as 3x4x3 however legroom was still excellent. IFE was disappointing and the choices of movies were just poor. However the moving map was of high quality. NRT-MNL leg on an older 767 but the seats were still comfortable and service was once again excellent. Overall. a very pleasant experience with ANA. While their hard product is average their service is what sets them apart. The crew are warm and friendly which many other highly rated airlines like Singapore lacks.,Promoter
Flew Air Canada rouge from Los Angeles to Calgary. I'm not usually claustrophobic but when I'm sitting perfectly straight up and my knees are still touching the seat in front of me it is very uneasy. The plane was also very old and dirty. We also tried to select seats in advance and were given a $15 charge for standard seats. I've never heard of charging customers to select standard seats before.,Detractor
Always delays even when the plane is the first one out in the morning. Frequently when there are going to be weather delays the airline won't cancel so you can make alternative arrangement until you have sat all day waiting. I fly frequently and American always has some excuse for why they can't help their delays. Sick of this airline.,Detractor
"Montreal to Spokane via Minneapolis, and extremely displeased with my Delta experience. Landed in MN to find the connecting flight tone delayed about 45 min because there was no pilot. Ok. Not a huge inconvenience. Board the plane to find out that I have been bumped from the aisle seat I specifically selected when booking the ticket and as the flight was full, was unable to get a aisle seat. Then we sat on the plane for almost another hour when it was announced due to a fuel leak we would have to deplane and take another plane. Extremely inconvenient as the flight is already terribly uncomfortable with the small space and terrible seats. And of course there is no compensation to passengers for the inconvenience. So all-in-all, will try to avoid flying delta for future travel needs when possible.",Detractor
Horrible experience. I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai. The plane was a tired creaky old B-777. Flight attendants whose average age was nearly 60 were grumpy and rude. Only a stale bagel was served. Definitely one of the worst flight experiences I had ever to endure.,Detractor
"  Copenhagen to Hong Kong via Stockholm. The transfer flight from Stockholm to Hong Kong was delayed from 2.30 to 5, then 5 to 7.40, then got cancelled altogether. The initial delay was informed through SMS, however, the subsequent delays and cancellation were not notified through any channel including SMS or email. Passengers were not updated until the very last min at the gate when they were actually lining up for boarding! 2We were told that the delay was caused by a lightning struck on the wing, and they were doing everything they can to get it back on the air within a couple hours. Unrealistic expectation! We saw nobody working on the plane which was parked right at the gate. If they were welding the hole as what we were told, shouldn't that be performed in a hanger? It's a Sunday, do you expect any Swede to work at all? Since we had access to the Lounge, we were told by the staff at gate to head to SAS Lounge located at the other end of the terminal",Detractor

"  San Francisco to Milan via Copenhagen. It is required to pay to reserve seats on SAS. It's $40 per person, per leg, which if you're doing a multiple leg flight (plus return flights) adds up very quickly. You can pick seats for free up to 12 hours (?) in advance online, which I did about 10 hours before the flight. Unfortunately my wife and I ended up separated from San Francisco to Copenhagen and there were nothing SAS staff could do, or felt like doing. Once I arrived in Copenhagen I went to the SAS desk to get some help, and hopefully get some better seats for the return flight 2 weeks later, I was greeted by a stone-faced lady that said the same thing as everyone else, she couldn't do anything. That seems to be the theme of SAS, stone faced workers that would rather not do anything, along with very strange seat policies designed to rip off the customers. The flights itself are decent, the A340 was in good condition with good individual in flight entertainment screens. I was under the impression that SAS was better than this, I guess it's reverted to being a low cost airline striving to penny pinch to the every end.",Passive

CDG-BKK-HKT. Last evening flight for Thai. Check-in in Paris was far from acceptable. I did not print my ticket and could not locate it on my phone. Security agent refused to let me go into check in although I pledged I was flying with Thai. A security supervisor came and intervened and I was allowed to the check in counter. Once at check-in it took the agent over 30 minutes to process! She then refused to give me the boarding pass as she said she could not locate my return ticket. I told her this is because it was a separate ticket to Vietnam and I showed her the e-ticket stored in the phone. It then took her over 10 minutes to clear with somebody on the phone. Once on board the 777 it was usual Thai friendliness and quality. My seat and my neighbour's failed after take off. Cabin crew did not bother fixing it and just asked us to move to other seats as there were plenty empty seats. The television in the 2nd seat did not work and I was moved to yet another seat. Transfer in Bangkok smooth but TG Domestic lounge facilities were basic. BKK-HKT short but the cabin crew managed to serve food and very friendly as well. It is comfortable but all facilities on board or on the ground seem to be old and worn.,Passive
"  Boston to West Palm Beach. I flew up to Boston on Spirit, I thought that was the worst of my trip (however, there was no charge for my emotional support dog to accompany me with Spirit), then I used JetBlue for my trip back home. The attendant at the counter told me I had to go over to another counter for my dog to board, but didn't tell me he needed to have his bag. His bag was in my check in bag. So, I went over to the other counter where I was told that he needed his bag, so they called to have my check in bag sent to the customer service desk one flight below the ticket counter. I had an emotional support dog with me and his certificate, shot record and special vest on him and because I didn't have the information on ""their forms"" I was charged $125.00 or that he could be put in the cargo bay with the luggage. Also, we were put through a separate line for security, which my son and I thought would take a shorter time. The TSA agents knew we were now late in getting to our gate, and made it impossible to get quickly thru the screening and we missed our flight. So we had to re-book to the next flight leaving. Then when landing, I was told that my emotional support dog had to be put back down into his bag. Since he is an ""emotional support"" animal, I should have been allowed to keep him with me on my lap! People with babies hold them on their lap, they aren't told the baby can't stay on their lap! The airline had changed the way they handle support dogs last year, I hadn't used JetBlue in years, nor will I ever fly with them again. I should receive my $125.00 back with an apology from this company for the way I was treated with my dog. I am 65 year senior citizen. I should not have been treated this way by the airline. I will never fly, nor will I recommend anyone I know ever to fly JetBlue.",Detractor
"Great vacation except we were put on Air Canada Rouge flights by Air Canada (Toronto-cancun and back)- even though our original booking was on Air Canada. We were not given a choice or told of the change or what the change would mean (and it did not equate to any kind of discount). I have never been so cramped on a plane - I'm only 5'5"" and my knees touched the back of the next chair when it was reclined - I couldn't lift my purse from under the seat in front (and bags bigger then a purse will not fit under the seat). My husband is 5'10 and couldn't fit his legs in front of him so had to encroach on my space. The person to my left was over 6' and also encroached on my space - claustrophobic. The first thing the flight attendant said to me as I reached my seat was ""do you like the legroom"" and laughed. One of the bathrooms was out of order for the flight. There are no movies unless you purchase a tablet for $10. We didn't try any of the purchased food so can't comment about it. Added to all this - originally we booked a 2 hour layover back from Mexico in Toronto to have time make it through customs and having to go through security again before connecting flights (sadly happens at TO airport)- our ""itinerary"" change to a rouge flight lowered this to not much more than an hour. Flight crew very friendly and young and inexperienced. This has put a very bad taste in our mouth re: Air Canada who we have flown dozens of times with in the past.

We flew Economy from SIN-HEL-LJU and then from DBV-HEL-SIN. The plane was an old but refurbished A340-300 and the IFE was updated. In terms of leg room and seat width it is as good as you can get in economy for long haul flights (I typically use SIA/Emirates/Qatar). Quality of the food served was average. Service was good and attentive. Transit in Helsinki airport was very smooth - we had two airport layovers. In all considering that we paid a very reasonable price we were very satisfied with Finnair and would recommend them. In fact because of my positive experience with them I have also decided to fly to Finnair SIN-MXP in October 2014. Again the prices are very reasonable.,Promoter
BKK-LHR. Written from the perspective of someone who for the last few years has only used EVA Business Class. Very fast check in at Bangkok the EVA lounge at Bangkok is well furnished and with an ample supply of food and drink. The flight itself was 10 minutes late departing but the time was made up during the flight and we arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The meals were satisfactory and well presented with never ending refills of tea or coffee a range of soft drinks were available throughout the flight. There was also a mid flight snack of rolls and sandwiches served during the flight and water and juice were offered every hour or at the touch of a button from the cabin attendants. The cabin crew were excellent with a good level of English and as I have always found with EVA pleasant and convivial. During the flight a passenger required the assistance of a doctor and the cabin crew dealt with the emergency in a very professional and calm manner. The seat legroom was good (I am over 6 ft tall) my only problem with the seats is that they do not recline enough for me to be fully comfortable but that is probably my Business Class travel being my expectation. I didn't use the IFE as I use my IPad but there was a good selection of movies and my travel companions' IFE were in use throughout the flight with no complaints. The toilets were kept spotless during the flight with a good supply if toiletries. It would be nice if Heathrow used two air bridges for unloading as the time taken to offload 300+ passengers at the furthest gate from Immigration plus the long walk from Gate 35 after a 12 hour flight is unwelcome but that just like the meltdown of the Immigration system at Heathrow is not under EVA's control.,Promoter

Tel Aviv - Warsaw - Wroclaw and back. TLV - WAW with Embraer 195 WAW-WRO-WAW with Embraer 175 WAW-TLV with Boeing 737-400. Embraer planes are very comfortable. Boeing 734 worn out. Good leg space flights on time crew mostly friendly. Since August 2013 there's practically no service on board. All one gets is a chocolate covered wafer and water! Even on the 4-hour flight from Tel Aviv to Warsaw (not to mention the 3 hours spent at the airport). More (sandwiches salads drinks beverages sweets) is available but one must pay. Needless to say ticket costs full price. LOT offers free meals only on flights lasting above 6 hours. That's a great pity! I loved LOT and used to fly with them 2-4 times a year. Now I only take them when I need to get to Poland. On the TLV- WAW route El Al offers by far a much better service (for - more or less - the same price).,Passive
  Glasgow to London Gatwick with British Airways. Absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight. I arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. I struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. No idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight. Pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly.,Detractor
"My second time flying Spirit and the last. First of all who doesn't want to save a little and spend it on activities? The problem is that you don't realize until after you have booked that more fees are coming. I knew there would be seat fees if I chose to sit next to my traveling companion and I also knew that I would have to pay for checked bags. What I didn't know until I received a reminder email to do online check in is that now Spirit also charges $10 per person if you do not do an online check in and print your boarding passes. After $160 extra for bags and cheap seats they want you to pay to check in at the airport too. The real topper of all this is that my flight from Dallas with a brief stop in San Diego then on to Cabo was all without any type of drinks because no one bothered to stock the plane so after you ordered and they swiped your card they came back and said ""Oh so sorry we are all out of that"". Also after you pay for those seats you may or may not get them. Its not worth the hassle and all the extra fees-at the end of the day it still costs as much to fly this ""discounted airline"" as it would to fly one of the others that is straight forward with the charges.

"  Taipei to New York via Beijing. Why you should not fly Air China. The flight from Taipei to New York seems a bit cheaper on the surface but there's a 14 hour layover in Beijing. So you need a hotel for that. Which, with a bit of drama I managed. Don't get the hotel in the terminal, get the one outside. Yes, they don't answer the phone, but it's still a valid if ultra ghetto place to sleep. More seriously when I got to NY I found the lock on my suitcase was broken. Checking I found the following missing an old Windows laptop, clothing, an iPod and iPad. I asked them for compensation but they're diligently stonewalling me with 'this is not the right number', 'you must claim within 7 days'. Even though I've called all the numbers and the emails they've sent me show someone in Air China got their documents emailed back inside the 7 day window. Right now they're just ignoring emails. Another interesting thing they said was 'did it have a lithium ion battery?"". The Windows laptop didn't as it happened. The iPod and iPad obviously did.

Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it. The onboard service was just on another level, but my greatest appreciation goes to the FA who attended to me, they were just so genuinely nice.

Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service.

Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.,Promoter
I took a flight from Netherlands to New Delhi via Moscow airport dated 16th December. I read all the reviews and statistics to check the possibility of any flight cancellation. Most of the reviews were negative but the stats were sound showing there were not significant delays. I was primarily hoping for 2 things 1). On time flight 2). Safe arrival of luggage. The flight from Amsterdam airport to Moscow (2 hours time) didn't had inflight entertainment. The other flight from Moscow to New Delhi (6 hours 20 minutes duration) had good inflight entertainment system. The quality of food was OK was not at its best. There were no delays in the connecting flights. I had to board from Terminal E to Terminal F which was nearby some 700 meters walking distance. However there were some issues with Moscow Airport - i). To my wonder the security staff was missing and the passengers had to wait for odd 20 minutes. They came scanned the handbags and put stamp on 'boarding pass' ii). the mini trolleys which are otherwise freely available on Amsterdam airport were simply unavailable. The passengers carrying hand bags had to face difficulty in rushing between terminals iii). The sign boards in Moscow airport are not mountedpositioned at appropriate locations.

" Newark to Singapore via Hong Kong. I fly CX every year on this trek back to Singapore from NJ and its very consistent. Boarding at Newark delayed by an hour due to a baggage issue but we did land right on time in HKG. The cabin crew were upbeat, warm and welcoming. They were pleasant, smiling and working efficiently throughout the flight. The meal service seemed slow but maybe had more to do with not having enough crew onboard to work such a large economy cabin. The meals onboard were the biggest disappointment. Portions seemed even smaller than before and the quality of both meals was certainly not up to par. Rice was dry and clumpy and the beef with it, overdone and lacked enough sauce. No salt and pepper sachets either. There is virtually no difference between the meals served on the long haul to the shorter medium haul sector to Singapore. The saving grace was the midflight snack bar that I stumbled on when I ventured to the back and to the opposite aisle. Good selection and better quality than the meals themselves, sadly. The seat on the A350 is probably one of the most comfortable, barring the seat back issue - which has been brought up here. Good cushioning, back support and legroom. The IFE screen was sharp, responsive and the selection a tad disappointing with insufficient newer films and I feel a better way to filter or sort the films available according to genre etc, would make selection easier. I loved the Tail and belly cams and the Moving Map was great. The toilets onboard seemed to be showing a surprising amount of wear for a 2 year old plane and the sinks in the 3 toilets I used, didn't drain properly with water remaining for a while. Announcements from the cockpit were informative and cheery for both legs and cabin crew announcements were clear. I think CX has a solid product - they just need to seriously up the ante on the economy food situation and expand the IFE a bit more.",Passive
Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight.,Promoter

I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.,Promoter

"  Madras to New York JFK return via Kuwait was my first time flying with Kuwait airways. The flight from Madras to Kuwait return (A340) was okay compared to the flight from Kuwait to New York return on a B747. There is no working in flight entertainment system for the flight to and fro NY though they had a small screen in front. Bad/broken seats, some of the staff are quite rude. The KWI-JFK flight landing at Shannon (Ireland) Airport came as a surprise for many of my co-passengers since it wasn't clearly mentioned in the ticket that there would be a stop in Dublin. There was also a delay in the flight from KWI-JFK. The passengers weren't explained why there was a delay. Security check done, bus is waiting downstairs, no passengers coming in to the gate, no work for almost 40-50 mins approx. I supposed they were waiting to pickup few other passengers from their other destinations and flights may have been delayed. There were no restrooms after the security check within the gate. Some of them were waiting to use the restroom at the flight. Since the flight was delayed, if they should use the restroom outside the lounge area of the gate they had to go through the whole process again. It caused big inconvenience to many. I think the flight is pretty much okay of it is your first time to fly and Kuwait Airways is your first ever company that you are flying with. For frequent fliers or for those who had already flown with other airlines it's a nightmare, at least to JFK which is their only destination in the US.

" Paris to Abu Dhabi. My flight was booked through Air France but was on an Etihad plane. Prior to the departure date I tried to book additional luggage online with Air France for 80 euros unaware that I was actually to fly with Etihad Airways. I was unable to book online for additional luggage and so called Air France. I was informed by Air France that although I wasn't able to book additional luggage online that they would put a note on my ticket for me to pay only 80 euros for the additional luggage when checking in at the airport. With this information I felt no need to investigate further. Upon arriving at the Charles de Gaulle airport to check in I was informed by Etihad Airways that I needed to pay 321.17 euros for the additional luggage! They informed me that there was no note on the ticket. When asking Air France at the airport to assist me with this they informed me that the only note on the ticket was that I had attempted to book additional luggage online, nothing about having to only pay 80 euros. Air France said they could do nothing about this situation and I had to pay the fee Etihad was demanding of me. Since I wanted to bring my belongings home and time was ticking I felt I had no option but to pay the amount demanded of me by Etihad Airways. Upon arriving in Australia I contacted Air France to request compensation for the additional amount I was asked to pay over the 80 euros. I informed them that had I known I would have had to pay such a high rate for the additional luggage with Etihad Airways I would have sought other cheaper methods to get my belongings home. Air France refused to give me the amount of 241.17 euros that I requested and said that I ought to ask Etihad Airways. I did not accept their suggestion since it was Air France at fault, not Etihad Airways.",Detractor
"  What kind of airline makes someone pay $200 to change a flight? Life happens and no one should have to pay more than their ticket originally cost to change a flight even to the next day. My boyfriend and I are flying to see his family and we need to stay an extra day due to something, my original ticket cost more than the day that I needed to change to but in the end other than the $200 per ticket I also have to pay $50 per ticket because It was booked through a third party. Let me tell you something about an airline that puts their customers first, it's not American Airlines. And honestly I'm not sure how great they do everything else but if I have to pay that much to switch I am never going to book with them again. I booked another ticket with southwest for the day because even though I won't get my money back for the American airline flight I found a cheaper one overall with Southwest, who isn't an airline I fly a lot but they have free flight changes so they just got themselves a new and very happy customer.",Detractor
NRT-SEA business class on 27 Oct. On time departure and early arrival. Ground services fine and lounge while busy had reasonable food and beverage options. Fantastic crew was very attentive in meeting all needs. Food was excellent - had western options for both main and arrival meals. B787-8 is an excellent aircraft. Noise levels down from A330 B767 B777 levels and noticed body felt better after arrival. Seat was comfortable - like the staggered seating and foot well was sufficiently large to allow for turning. A small amenity kit was provided and toothbrushes available in lav. Toilets with bidet features were novel. Overall an excellent flight.,Promoter

" Toronto to Munich. Aircraft was ok Boeing 787-9 with terrible light blue painting. Seat pitch was okay. Very basic service. There was no welcome drink, no warm towel. No amenities and no menu. Food was tasteless chicken in a plastic disk. There was offering of drinks and wine. No 2nd drink offering. There was no snacks during flight, when I went to the galleys, the only that they could offer me were some crackers. For breakfast they offer only a piece of cake and coffee. Flight attendants were nice but old. The company should place younger staff on long flights instead of the YUL-YYZ route. The flight on YUL-YYZ was on A330 and they served only juices and coffee, you had to pay for food. IFE was ok.",Detractor
" Flew Hong Kong to London with Cathay Pacific. The menu option read exactly ""Mushroom fusilli and tomato concasse"", however it was just one small mushroom sliced 5 times garnishing pasta with a tomato sauce. I believe ""tomato concasse"" would normally be crushed tomatoes. No sign of that. The menu option was, Stir fried egg noodles with chicken, vegetables and 2 dumplings. However the amount of chicken and vegetables could be held on one tablespoon. It was essentially just stir fried noodles. The dumplings were small but good. I understand I was flying economy and wasn't expecting Haute Cuisine, however using fancy words to describe something so substandard is just wrong and leads to disappointment when other menu options could have been chosen. The wine was nice but one small glass was less than some other airlines serve. Other aspects of the trip were really good including the plane and service etc. However it would have been good to be able to select a seat and not have one automatically allocated as someone taller than 6 foot could be uncomfortable in a 78 cm pitched seat.",Passive
" Warsaw to Accra via Amsterdam. The plane from Warsaw was late so I had to hurry up to catch my flight to Ghana in Amsterdam. Very short time for transfer. During boarding to Accra I told the staff that its very important to fly with my luggage and asked them to reassure its packed to the plane. They replied me they would do it for me. I boarded the plane with trusting them. They delayed my luggage (4 bags 23 kg each). I did not know when I would get it back so had to book the hotel in Accra instead of going by the car directly to Kumasi after landing. I went to Ghana during my time off from work. Delaying my luggage ruined my trip! The third day I had to buy some aids to be able to start my work with kids. Meantime I had to struggle with organizing picking my luggage up from the airport as I was in Kumasi when it finally arrived. They did not organized delivery to Kumasi. I involve few people to help me with my challenge. They called the airport every few hours, they were looking for somebody we can trust to pick my luggage up. I paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me, he passed the bags to the bus to Kumasi, I also paid for the taxi to the place I stayed near Kumasi. Etc. I had to buy items like clothes, shoes, cosmetics, drops, etc. I had to buy to use as I landed just in pair of jeans, trainers and jacket. I did not know when my luggage would be with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to KLM. Attached about 10 invoices for the items I had to buy. KLM replied me after one week. They decide to pay me only 100 EUR compensation. For delaying 4 bags! I had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. I did not agree with their decision. But they are not going to change their mind. Its very sad and unfair how they treated me in a very challenging situation. No empathy. No sense of responsibility. I learnt the lesson. Never again with KLM!",Detractor
"I had the best economy flying experience with Asiana Airlines. It was my first time flying with them and I have absolutely no regrets. The B777-200 showed no signs of ageing and the service onboard was exceptional. Toothbrushes, toothpaste, blankets, headphones and even slippers were distributed to all passengers. A massive range of drinks were available and served very regularly throughout the flight by the kind onboard staff who made sure everybody had something to drink. Asiana sure love their teas as there were many available such as ginseng, green, black and Jasmine tea. I was able to select my seat for free on the Asiana mobile app which was a blessing as I remember having to pay over Â£10 for seat selection on BA a while back. Lots of legroom and the seat headrests were adjustable. I've previous comments mentioning that the entertainment has been limited on Asiana flights but that was not the case for me as I saw many films that were only in cinemas a couple of months ago with a wide selection of film genres to choose from. Maybe I had witnessed an improvement? The two hour flights between Seoul and Tokyo were of the same quality as the long haul in terms of staff service and meal quality. The meals on all four flights with Asiana were outstanding for economy class. On the long hauls, menus are given out to all passengers with a choice between Korean or Western meals. The Korean meal was definitely the winner when it came to presentation, but the quality of the food for both meals was very high and proper metal cutlery is used. The price of all four flights was well below Â£1k. I will certainly fly with Asiana again, simply for the amazing service they provide compared to my past long haul experiences with BA and Virgin. An affordable premium service by Asiana Airlines, I highly recommend.",Promoter

" Honolulu to Dallas. The flight listed I didn't even make because this airline chose to overbook and make early online check in impossible for my class, the site quite literally read ""we currently don't have enough seats to assign one to you now, please check in upon arrival at airport for seat assignment"". I was using transportation provided by the airport so had no control over my arrival time, I did arrival an hour early and got denied a place so my flight got bumped. Didn't read anywhere that seats were first come first serve, would've booked Delta had I known. I've currently been stuck in the airport 8 hours and will be arriving 6 after my expected arrival time, absolutely outrageous. The American Airlines employee response to my ""inconvenience"" was ""well, this change won't be charged, and at least you'll make it home""....Are you kidding?! I didn't book the flight I got stuck on purely for the inconvenience to me, and round trip means you get to go home. She had the audacity to claim it could be worse and they could make me pay for their lack organization and counting skills, it's not that difficult American Airlines, simply count the seats on your airplane and stop selling tickets when you hit that number, account for the pilot and any staff needed on board, believe it or not it's that simple. They did provide a $12 food voucher at the airport that was only brought to my attention by another passenger who got bumped, not even an airline employee, nice gesture but doesn't make up for the 14 hours of my life I won't get back. Yes American Airlines that's math you've obviously not seen it before. Ridiculous.",Detractor

In Houston we had only one hour and half transit, but we had to get our luggage, pass the immigration and get in again. It's been very stressful in 1h30 to do that. We arrive at the gate just on time before they close, and the company was giving / selling our place to other people! Lucky we get there on time because they would not have waited for us!

" Sydney to Port Macquarie, this was my first flight with QANTAS but gave me a very bad experience. I like to take photo especially inside the cabin.

I follow his instruction and put down my camera without any single word, but he shouted at me and wanted me to delete the photo immediately. Although he being rude to me I still follow his instruction to delete the photo of their cabin. After he confirmed I deleted the photo and he just went away. When the aircraft landed and I walked out from the air craft, the 2 cabin crews never want to look at me and just shown a hatred face. I might did wrong to take photo of their cabin but I do not deserve a shout and rude treatment from them, I can understand that not all QANTAS cabin crew behave in this way but these 2 cabin crews were the worst cabin crew that I ever met.

"Boise to Atlanta via Houston. United Airlines just cover their mistake.The flight was delayed for 13 hrs in Boise Idaho. Part for the delay was the weather and the last 3-4 hrs it was for maintenance.

They promise that if we lose our connection I will have a hotel and vouchers for food. When I arrived at the United customer service at Houston Airport, they said that It was not a record of the maintenance. So weather does not pay for the hotel. They denied that it was maintenance.

Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.,Detractor
" Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don't understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around Â£320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. So overall, it's a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.",Passive
The worst long distance flight I have experienced - Toronto to Venice (flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto). The trip from Toronto could not have been more unpleasant from staff to seating entertainment and meals. Unable to see steward giving safety information (no video equipment). Dinner was delivered consisting of pasta which had freezer burn with a tough and flavourless beef stew on top. No choices. Drinks were not offered. Managed to get some water. Breakfast was 1/2 piece of banana loaf. Coffee came in tiny cups - no refills ever offered even after request. Seats cramped - no personal control of air conditioning etc. Very cold in our section. If I had wanted to watch anything I would have had to rent an I-pad for $10 since I do not own one. Crew seemed to do a required task and then totally disappear. They were not in any way gracious or helpful. My carry on was specifically purchased to meet all the restrictions of this flight but could not fit either under the seat or in the overhead bin. I could have done this flight on another airline and wish to heaven I had - the cost would have been the same or at most only very little more. Never again!

The planes seemed new, but there was trash in the magazine compartment, with magazines themselves dirty or missing. Overall, not much to do on a cross-atlantic flight, make sure you have your own entertainment.

"  I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own.

Very pleasant business class flight on Air China from Beijing to Houston on gleaming 777-300. The highlight is the seat. It creates a very comfortable lie-flat bed and comes with a large fluffy duvet and large pillow - making for very restful sleep. Cabin crew was friendly attentive and hard-working albeit robotic programmed and not proactive in responding to passenger needs/desires. Food was decent - about average for international business class. Wine list was decent too but crew served white wine and champagne warm. We had to constantly ask for refills of wine and water in very small glasses. Air China would do well to learn the fine points of premium service from Star Alliance partner Asiana.

Good on time flight with usual impeccable pilot. Bought a coffee - dreadful apparently artisan coffee. Almost no eye contact with cabin crew. Flight was a good price.",Passive
"  Adelaide to Singapore and the best crew I have had on a flight. Two members addressed passengers (including myself) by name for the whole flight. Attendants were chatty and polite, and spent time providing passengers with hints of what to see and do in Singapore. Very frequent rounds of drinks. Aircraft was clean. IFE was not the latest generation but the screen size was big enough and the selection of movies was more than adequate. The only downside was food, where Singapore Airlines normally does not shine. Portions were big but quality can be better. Ground staff at Adelaide airport very polite and helpful. SilverKris lounge small but well-stocked. Overall, a great experience.",Promoter
"BKK-DEL-BHX on 9th December and you do get what you pay for (not a criticism)! We left BKK on time and the first leg was around 4 hours on a fairly old A320 which looked a bit shambolic but did the job. Staff were almost comically surly as a first impression although once you engaged a bit they got better. They dealt with some very rude passengers so in the end we sympathized them more than anything. There was simply no IFE at all but I had brought a book so that didn't make too much difference. The pilot guided us very well through a long patch of turbulence and we slowed right down near landing in response to fog at Delhi. Overall it was pretty poor but pilot seemed experienced and we got there safely so not complaining. The connection was ok and we had a slight delay due to aforementioned fog but this time we were on the 787 dreamliner. Lovely modern aircraft with decent IFE but nowhere near as good as Emirates though a lot is invested in Bollywood stuff. The toilets could have done with cleaning. The food was reasonable with the lamb curry on the first flight the best and all were passable if not great. Staff were a little more enthusiastic on the 2nd flight which was good although the audible ""bing"" sound every time anyone requested crew assistance was unnecessary. Staff were reasonably attentive and drinks were available throughout. I would recommend as it's value for money.",Passive
" Chicago to San Francisco. This airline charges $30 for bags checked, individually. I agree, but do not agree with charging for backpacks. The purpose of charging for bags was to get the TSA to screen faster, so sometimes people pack a lot of stuff and bring huge luggage that is ridiculous. Now if we want to check in a small backpack because we have 5 oz bottles of sauce from the country we visited, that does not make sense. At that point the airline is charging for profit and not thinking about its customer's needs nor about the origin of this screening rule, 9-11. The airline is taking profit from a tragedy we all endured and not thinking logically! For my family there is no more flying United. Our choices have power.",Detractor
Flew BKK-USM-BKK in Jan 2014. While I do find their prices a bit on the expensive side Bangkok Airways is a really nice airline to fly with.

"  I booked 2 tickets from Los Cabos to Newark in Business class. Ten minutes before flight boarded I was notified that there was a broken seat 4B in business class and one person in my party needed to be bumped to coach. This seat was broken prior to leaving Newark to SJD. I should have been notified prior to going to the airport so I could have found alternative flights in business class. I should have even been told when I checked in at the airport. There should be better communications with passenger if they are going to get bumped and not tell them 10 minutes before boarding. Furthermore I thought it was proper for an airline to ask for volunteers for compensation and not just be bumped which never occurred. United Airlines customer service is horrible and have zero care or concerns for passengers and I fly every other week, always in business or first class. I will only fly Delta and American Airlines in the future. United Airlines repeated complete disregard for passengers is clearly apparent and I will never put myself in this situation again.

For four hours, though, I can suck it up and enjoy decent service from the 3 flight attendants. Paying for food, booze and iPads is relatively good value as well.

"easyJet from Gatwick to Hurghada return on an A320. Outbound we had a 2 hour delay due to a spillage on the runway at LGW. On reaching Hurghada the captain was forced to divert to Luxor due the runway being closed due to debris. We re-fuelled at Luxor and flew back to Hurghada, and crew dealt with this in a professional and understanding way. Concerning seats on the A320, outbound we had the 'old' seats, and on the return flight we had the new seats. We were able to make direct comparison. Our verdict is that the new seats offer more legroom and are more stable and comfortable. I was relieved to see that the seats do not recline, a big reason that we select EasyJet. One criticism is that on the return flight the cabin crew had run out of food (rolls, baguettes, etc) by the time they reached us. We were told that this is a frequent thing. I noted that they had plenty of duty free perfumes and goods to sell. I would suggest more food is loaded at Gatwick and less perfumes etc.",Promoter

A bit of a wait for my luggage ( it took about 30 minutes) but immigration check in Paris was really quick. The only thing that I find really annoying is how some of the staff at check in at Dublin Airport can act.

" London to Bahrain. I'm a regular on the LHR-BAH route but this was the first time on the 787. A huge improvement generally compared to the A330, and that certainly wasn't bad. It's very quiet and smooth, and the new staff uniform is very smart. The seat is excellent and all-aisle access is a good move. The handheld IFE controller is a down point though, not very intuitive how to use it. In fact, IFE generally is a miss... the screen is massive and high quality, but the film and TV selection is small, and seems to just be lifted from the A330, a big miss to upgrade this. Gulf Air food is normally very good but on this flight it wasn't great, with a dry prawn salad and a massively overcooked beef dish. However, I think this is a one off that I can forgive based on history. Little things matter, so for the first time I've seen on a GF flight, they handed out landing cards whilst en route - just made arriving a bit simpler. So overall, a big jump in the right direction, but don't waste the excellent IFE screen with poor content.",Promoter

Took a flight from Toronto to Las Vegas yesterday. Scheduled departure was 8.40 am. At 9.00 they announced they were a bit behind and a plane was being towed to the gate. 45 minutes later still no plane and an announcement we're delayed to 10.30. At 10.30 an announcement they're still waiting on an aircraft and we can present our boarding pass to a few restaurants in the terminal for up to $10 worth of food and drinks. At 11.30 a plane arrives and we get boarded by 12. At which point they announce that the pilot and co-pilot have logged too many hours and we are waiting on a new crew. The new pilot arrives by 12.30 and tells us our plane was delayed because it had to be tested after getting overnight maintenance. She announces the co-pilot will be there soon. At 1.00 they announce that they need to reboot the computer system and we will be leaving shortly thereafter. By 1.30 the co-pilot and everyone seem accounted for but wait! We now have used so much fuel we need refuelling. We finally got underway at nearly 2.15 after waiting to refuel. This airline is a complete joke. As a Canadian I am embarrassed that they call themselves our national airline. All of these delays occurred after being forced to wait in Pearsons 'cattle pen' lounge for getting into Customs. We finally left at the same time we were scheduled to land. Numerous people on board missed connecting flights but the crew didn't seem to care. As an aside the crew seem very young and inexperienced and not well trained in how to handle these extreme flight delays with customers. If I could assign zero stars I would. The whole process was beyond frustrating I will always choose to fly via other airports and carriers when not forced to take Air Canada for work.,Detractor

" Phoenix to Chicago. My flight was cancelled and I received my notice at all - no email, no SMS. I was continually checking the flight status on the airline site and it was not shown as cancelled. I only found out when I arrived at the terminal. Frontier cancelled the flight for ""weather"" (standard snow) but I knew that other airlines were flying out such as AA, United and Delta. I was offered a flight 6 days later which I could not accept. They offered no other options. Because of my work schedule and monetary reasons, I was forced to buy a ticket on another airline which was six times the cost because it was a last-minute purchase. Their customer care offered no compensation for the huge inconvenience and cost. They even claimed they sent an email about the cancellation. That is not true. I purchased my check-in bag online after the supposed cancellation email and I received an confirmation email for the purchase. I also received an email the day before for early check in. So their claim rings hollow. When I told their customer service about my issue, they responded with a canned message. No empathy, no concern.

"After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return. Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week.

"  I had a conference to attend in Toronto. I was flying United and my itinerary was to fly from Hong Kong via San Francisco and then Chicago to Toronto. My United Airlines flight from Hong Kong was late to take off for over an hour and I only had an hour 25 minutes transit time. When I cleared the customs, rechecked my luggage, and ran to the gate, it was closed. After working through issues and arrival time, I was rerouted to take a direct flight from San Francisco to Toronto on Air Canada. This was my first experience with Air Canada and didn't know what to expect. I went to the gate 45 minutes before the flight time, no one was even at the counter. The ground crew showed up around 25 minutes and didn't start boarding until 10 minutes prior to the departure time. I immediately asked a flight attendant to fill my empty water bottle after boarding. I then found out how smart the move was. First, this 5-hour trans-border flight included no drinks (not bottled water and you had to ask before they would give you water) or food. The flight attendants' main duty was to sell earbuds, snacks, and drinks to each customer. Thus, it took them 3 hours to reach the last row where I was. Another issue was that they sold some kind of hot snack. One of the flight attendants walked by me numerous times loudly to do heating. They did not go to the next row until the ordered food was given to the paying customer. The interior of this plane was worn with rather uncomfortable seats and entertainment programs were ancient with mostly Canadian shows. The flight attendants could not offer any arrival information, not even the general temperature range at that time of the day, and Toronto was their hometown.",Detractor

I asked to speak with a Manager and her response was ""Mam he's just going to tell you the same thing"" and I said I don't care, I need to speak with one. Well the Manager was horrible because I told them there was no way I could return Monday and that I was completely stranded and needed to get home Sunday. When I asked why was the flight cancelled he said ""the weather"" my response was ""sir I'm in Tampa and it's clear skies"" and the next thing I know I was placed instantly on hold, where I waited minutes and then the phone hung up. I called back several times with no response. I did there call back option when the sweetest woman who took her time trying to get me home on Sunday but said there was nothing else leaving out and it was too late for the one that was leaving at 4. This is how I knew there was a flight but the other two decided my faith even though I informed them of my situation. The agent found a flight and told me I could get to the airport and ask for assistance with a hotel but they don't refund money due to weather. She walked me through the flight details and I said wait let me take the information down, but she said it's coming through email. I saw the email instantly, so how ironic that hers came through but the alleged cancellation email did not. So my 1 hour no stop trip that was canceled has turned into 7 hours + with a stop in San Antonio TX, Dallas, another flight, then home from 3:30 PM -9:55 PM. No apology from Management, inconvenienced, stranded with a 12 year old, no clean clothes, no food, and no money. It's safe to say they can take off anytime without my family. This took away the joy, excitement, and turned my day into a living nightmare. For future events, a simple apology, and a notification goes a long way. I could have tried to make arrangements but I guess that wasn't an option for them. Thanks for the disappointment.",Detractor
  My experience with Singapore Airlines was decent at best. The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didn't feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.,Detractor
"Travelled LHR-PER via SIN January 2015. Flight from London was on a brand new A380 really comfortable great IFE good food good food friendly and attentive crew. Couldn't fault anything. Flight from Singapore was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft then they were cleaning and then it was announced there was a problem with the aircraft and they had to get a replacement. After a 2 hour delay we finally get to the gate my partner who is 6' 7"" and has had DVT asked about extra legroom seats (of which none had been available at the time of booking). After checking the system they said they had no leg room seats left and he should have purchased at the time of booking but as I said this wasn't available. After boarding the flight and finding our seats we see that 4 of the extra legroom seats have children in them with feet that don't even touch the floor. Safe to say my partner was fuming as he wedged himself into his seat. The flight from SIN-PER was on an old plane and the IFE wasn't great. The screens were bad quality but that was probably due to age of the plane. The crew were really attentive and brought hot towels and drinks throughout the flight. Overall Singapore are great with friendly and attentive staff. However they shouldn't sell extra legroom seats to children.",Promoter
  San Francisco to Orlando. When I booked it was not made obvious that we would have to pay for hand luggage. I only realised when looking at reviews three days before. When we arrived we were told there was a 35 minute delay. Then after going through check out it it became 90 minutes. Our flight was due to leave 1125pm. It then started to show that it wouldn't leave till 330am. So far this was on the board and nobody talking to us. When eventually the ground staff appeared the attitude of all the female staff absolutely stank. The only person who seemed to seemed to empathise was a male agent. Unfortunately it was not long before he went off duty. When we tried to ask the female staff they told us to sit down and be patient and that it was a mechanical problem. People were asking for food and water and they were refusing. The airport was hot and every cafe was closed and we were not allowed out. At one point all the rest rooms were closed too. To add insult to injury the staff kept disappearing and returning with hot drinks for themselves. At 6am they gave us a 10 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the price of a bun and bottle of water. The delays kept changing to later and later. They gave people option of refund but would not say when you get luggage back so we did not take that option. Also at that late stage another flight have cost 300 dollars extra per person. It would also have taken ten days for refund to process but we would have taken the option if they could have been more specific about us getting luggage back. At about 8am the staff disappeared and the police had to come to calm everybody down. Frontier does not work with other airlines and they only fly to Orlando once a day from San Francisco and would have kept us there for two days at least had that plane cancelled. Anytime anybody complained they threatened to throw them off the flight. The most frustrating thing was not being given any proper information. They said we would get compensation of a voucher to travel with them again. We would never in a million years travel with Frontier again. I advise everybody to read reviews before booking with any airline. I made the mistake of not and lost a day of my holiday. We eventually left at 1050am. The cabin crew were pleasant enough but there was no food to purchase. Only snacks. Ridiculous on a five hour flight even without what happened to us. We feel we should get a refund.,Detractor
"  I flew with TAP from Lisbon to Zurich from where I had connecting flight to Helsinki. When I arrived at the airport the flight had a 20 minute delay. After 30 minutes or so, the gate finally opened and we took the shuttle bus to the plane. Upon arrival, it became evident that the plane still was not ready as the shuttle driver left the bus and left everyone stuck inside standing on a hot day for over 10 minutes. After that we were finally able to board, but the plane only took off about 40 minutes later. During this time I attempted to ask both the cabin staff and the captain on how long it would take to depart and none were able to give me an answer. The flight eventually departed roughly 1h30 late, which caused me to miss all the connection flights. While in Zurich I contacted the ground staff, who were unable to provide an alternative flight which would allow me to arrive in time for my presentation. I ended sleeping in Zurich and returning to Portugal the day after. Back in Portugal, I waited in line to get the â‚¬400 compensation at the company customer support counter, but I was dismissed by the staff who didn't care for my situation and just gave me an email address. Still waiting on resolution on this situation. Onboard quality is also terrible. The food is just a sandwich and a sample-sized yogurt. On the stretch back home I was thirsty as there were no drinks available. The airplane was dirty. There are no in-flight entertainment options. I have flown low-cost flights before and even those have much higher quality than TAP, at a fraction of the cost. It is a miracle that this company can continue to operate in these conditions. I urge fellow travels to avoid TAP at all costs.",Detractor
" London to Phoenix, BA289 yesterday. The plane was supposed to land at 1835. However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines.",Detractor

" Washington to Panama City. Departed out of IAD - At Counter - Could not Check-in bags directly to my destination DAV, In-flight the airplane is dated and need upgrades to be consider Business class. The attendant did no mentioned where to plug electronics and there were no entertainment at all on the plane. I follow the United Airlines instructions to login with no luck. Copa should not assume that travelers know all these things especially on this old type of airplanes. Arrived to PTY - Picked my baggage and pay for a luggage cart to go through customs after that I could not take the cart to go upstairs to drop off my bags to the COPA domestic counter I have to actually find a gentleman that carried my bags by hand . No signs, no directions, no one from COPA to ask what was next. Waited in line for about one hour, very hot and crowded counter with only one staff assisting in the web checked in counter. I had to asked twice to the staff at the counter where to go next, he seem not very knowledgeable. Return Flight from DAV - I was charged for my baggage and they could not send my bags directly to IAD. I was very frustrated because I did not want to go through what I experienced on my arrival to Panama.The lady at the counter said because my tickets were not purchased together, but I explained that I purchased the tickets at the same day and time. I found with today's electronic age that this simple change could not be made possible, I asked the staff to please call the manager. The ""not too friendly manager"" seems bother by my request and said that I have purchased my tickets separately and this was the policy and since I was flying domestic I needed to pay for my luggage, At this time I told the manager okay even though I think that the entire situation was absurd I will pay but please check my baggage directly to IAD - The manager literally looked at me, say nothing and then she tell the staff to check my baggage through and say nothing to me and walked away as if she was doing me a non desire service, it was very humiliating to beg for an hour. I was the last one entering the plane. Departure from PTY to IAD - the complete COPA terminal gates 1 through was extremely hot - about 90+ degrees no place to purchase water or cool off and all the belts for fast walking were not working. Even though I did stay in the COPA lounge I walked to the gate one+ hour earlier, but still very uncomfortable unhealthy environment at the gates. Again on this leg the aircraft was dated and no entertainment. The young man that attended was extremely polite and very nice, he really made the difference on my frustration of the whole trip. I purchased upgrades for the complete flight and felt as if I was flying economy (For an international Flight) The business class did not feel as such. I used to fly on COPA all the time until three years ago. I started using Delta or United planes and then go to DAV on AirPanama. After three years I decided to come back to COPA to be even more disappointed. I am not a complainer and I think this is my first review to an Airline ever, yes Copa seems convenient with the direct flight to PTY and DAV but living in the DC area, I have many choices on airlines, quality service and amenities. Very disappointed that I traveled with COPA.",Detractor

"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated).",Passive

The problem was changing an existing ticket using the helpdesk telephone number. If you ever find you need to change your ticket over the telephone then DON'T. I tried for 12 hours on and off, sat on a supermarket pay phone in Argentina and got nowhere at all. I was told each time that I would be contacted to give me a new price. Every time I called it was the same answer...where would you like to fly, we can not help until you are contacted by the specialist department, you must wait etc. I had a sleepless night in my hostel not knowing if I had a flight and unable to arrange alternative plans until I knew.

They can't send it to my hotel or deposit to my bank, only pick up available. Which will cost me half a day. One on vacation, this is lost one day.

" Vienna - Paris CDG in Economy almost a year ago, transferring in CDG to an AF flight to the UK. Flight was booked with AF as a codeshare. Checked in at the manned premium OS counter (due to frequent flyer status), which was fast and friendly. Boarding â€“ as almost in VIE with OS - slightly chaotic, but an average experience, as well as the flight itself. Solid, but not more. Drinks were free, however Austrian Airlines does not serve actual food in Y. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to a ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. While we made it to the new gate before departure time, the flight was already closed. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. No chance to make the connection. AF then rebooked us to flight leaving 6 hours later. Then we had to wait 1 hour (!) at the counter till AF got the approval from OS to issue a meal voucher for the delay, but OS could not care less to and needed to be called multiple time before they finally sent an approval. Simply ridiculous. Also, compensation for the delay under EU law was denied by OS citing extraordinary circumstances. How can a slightly later ATC slot be extraordinary circumstances? This is business as usual and flight statistics show that this is the usual delay for this morning flight. Even an intervention by the Austrian Customer Protection Agency did not help. OS denied their reasoning, as well. Will not recommend OS, as customer service and attitude handling the delay and compensation was terrible.",Detractor
Do not fly Air Rouge unless you are happy being canned in like a sardine. I could not reach under my seat without hitting my face on the seat in front of me that is how tight the seats are packed and this is coming from a person who is practically 5 feet tall. I have always flown AC but now that I have flown my first Air Rouge flight it I feel cheated. The worst part is that this horrible flight was not a discounted flight I paid $1000 for an overpriced flight from San Diego.

"My husband and I were travelling to Egypt for a long weekend break. On arriving Nairobi airport, there was a 30 minute delay on the flight (acceptable), so the flight was leaving at 8.30 instead of 8.00am. We boarded the flight and by 8.30 we were ready to take off. Then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical problem and will be sorted in 5 minutes, those 5 minutes turned into 2 hours and all passengers were getting apprehensive as the crew kept on saying 5 minutes and then we were told to disembark. So everyone got out of the plane and within literally 5 minutes we were all called back on, saying the flight is now ready. We all boarded and guess what sat in the flight again for two hours with the same 5 minute story. At 12.30pm we were told the flight is now cancelled and to disembark again and would be given more information outside. We waited for another 1 hour for our bags and the crew told us that they are trying to get another flight on the same day (Saturday) or we wait will Monday to fly out as they don't fly on sundays. Considering we were coming back on Tuesday that was a pointless option, we then spoke to the Egyptair Nairobi Airport Manager who said there was no way we would fly on the same day so we had to wait till Monday. His assistant told us that there was an Ethiopian airline flying in a couple of hours if we wanted to take that and then return with Egyptair on Tuesday as schedules. They agreed to the same and signed our ticket for a full/part refund. We even double checked with him if we flew with Ethiopian airline one way to Cairo would Egypt air refund our one way ticket - to which he said yes and even spoke to our travel agent on the phone. We then took the Ethiopian airlines (paid extra) and reached Cairo. Its an amazing city with amazing people. On the way back on Tuesday, Egyptair had cancelled our return so we had to get that sorted and after another 3 hour wait in the flight due to mechanical fault again the flight took off and got to Nairobi not forgetting we reached work late on Wednesday because of the flight delay. Back in Nairobi when our travel agent asked for the refund to get sorted from Egyptair, it took them a month to reply and they said they will not refund our one way ticket. This is the most ridiculous customer service we have ever received especially after all the inconveniences caused to us by Egyptair. Wasted 8 hours at the airport, had to take another flight and spend extra money and not one person from Egyptair apologized or even cared. A good number of us used Ethiopian airlines that Saturday as Egyptair promised a refund. It is the most horrible airline and I would not recommend anyone to travel with it.",Detractor

"  Delhi to London via Kuwait. DEL-KWI was delayed by 2 hours, smooth flight, nice new aircraft, personable cabin crew, (but no amenity kit in business class). My initial layover was supposed to be 2 hours and I expressed my concern about making my connection because of the delayed first leg to both check-in staff and cabin crew, to be assured that there would be no problem in making the connection. Landed at KWI around 4.45am Kuwait time. The KWI-LHR flight was supposed to depart at 5am. Got out of the aircraft to find there was no facilitation for transit passengers. Eventually managed to find the departure gate despite misleading signage. Again asked if my luggage would get transferred. Kept on being reassured that luggage was sure to get on with me. Eventually the flight took off around 6am, and reached Heathrow at 11am, an hour behind schedule. My baggage was not delivered at Heathrow. I filed a Property Irregularity Report at Terminal 4, specifically explaining that I was requesting priority handling of baggage hereafter up to delivery to me. No baggage after 30 hours. Spoke to the local courier company which delivers delayed bags. First told that baggage would be delivered 4-5pm BST. That time passed. Called again to be told that baggage on a delivery vehicle and will be delivered around 10pm. I was also told no one communicated that my bags should be provided priority handling. At the time of the review I am still awaiting my bags. There's no notification from Kuwait. They're rather prompt in washing their hands off this. All their ground operations are handled by ASC Handling. I am not sure if there is any recourse or compensation available to me. All in all, despite the pleasant enough flights, delay and loss of baggage is especially annoying. What's even worse is the Airline's insistence that they shouldn't be blamed somehow (the baggage transfer in Kuwait was being done on the carousel equipment that belonged to the local aviation authority, and baggage handling at LHR is contracted to ASC Handling. I find that assertion frankly untenable and fairly ridiculous. There's probably good reason not to continue to use KU in the future.",Detractor

Also, the plane from Boston to ZÃ¼rich was very cramped and when reclined, there is zero space.

"Avios points flight to London from Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though given flying just Christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. The BA club lounge at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrÃ©e dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you all"" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is a dated cabin product. The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. Now, crawling over a stranger to reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of storage space mean that the BA product is way inferior to Air Canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers. My loyalty is now being tested and with the constant devaluing of the Executive Club benefits including mileage flight availability and cost I am now questioning my loyalty to British Airways.",Passive

"  London Heathrow to Geneva return. Appalling airline. The booking process is dreadful - they charge if you want to change seat in economy, I have been told they will be charging for food and drink from January, and the website very difficult to use. Their customer ""service"" via phone or email is abysmal (they are extremely rude, give completely wrong information, and I have been cut off, given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages). Whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely, many are extremely unhelpful. This week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker (the bag was not oversized, but I have a bad back at present, and I asked him very politely) - yet he outright refused though he helped other people. I flew Club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and I had to actively ask him to clean it. Which he did, but with very bad grace. I avoid British Airways if I can, but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs. And every single time I do fly with them, I am reminded why I dislike them so much.",Detractor

Except for the hassle of change of flights and following up on re-imbursement (holding time of 30 minutes on the phone), it all worked fine. Though never got to fly Spirit, the baggage fees were returned and so I am ok with it and willing to give Spirit another try for the next destination.

" Travelled 21 & 22 Jan 2018 with Qatar Airways from Ho Chi Minh via Doha to Entebbe and Kigali. Reliable airline, punctual flights, world class service, good drinks, poor food with no diversity, small portions, clean, newer aircrafts. Good lounge in Doha with slumber rooms. Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don't they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been Â½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP. Lousy and expensive WiFi offered on-board with lots of patronising registration and information requirements. Charity collection â€œEducate a Childâ€ is widely announced, intrusive and useless: they still claim to help 58 million uneducated children as they also did 5 years ago.

"  Delhi to Jaipur. Catastrophic reservation system and customer cervice I have booked a fully flexible return ticket online (via iPhone) on Jan 1st 2019, for departure in early Feb'19. The booking process is extremely cumbersome, also it seems to be mandatory to pay for every single aisle seat on this airline. All payment options for international passengers incur convenience fees which is extremely annoying. On Jan 3rd, needed to change the return flight. Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online. Promptly, on Jan 4th received a response which was completely unrelated and misleading, incl the proposal to contact their domestic call center for further help. Went down to their local agent & explained the issue. Nevertheless they talked me though the online process again. When I was about to leave their office I was told that online modifications only work using the Google Chrome browser. Just cancelled the entire booking and won't consider IndiGo ever again even without ever flying with them. What a terrible airline.",Detractor
" Manila to Istanbul. I was hoping the return flight would be better that the outbound, Istanbul to Manila. I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Detractor
"  Venice to Los Angeles via Moscow. I booked this last minute due to Air Berlin going bankrupt and cancelling our flights. Had some hesitation, but overall I had a good experience. Premium economy rate was reasonable, however seat choice was problematic. The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat. The waiting room in Moscow airport are small, I would find an empty waiting area and head to our terminal once we are closer to boarding. Or in our case we stayed at the V capsule hotel in the airport. Boarding is chaos, no special group boarding, just weave and cut your way into the entrance.",Promoter

The people on the ground gave conflicting answers, the people at the help desk couldn't help. We were told we couldn't rebook on a different flight, and then overheard them doing exactly that for other people, but when we got back up to the desk, the alternate flight was full.

"  Flew United Airlines, first class from Los Angeles - Chicago and return. Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually ""snipped"" was more like it) ""no, we have only one serving per person"". For a first class ticket, you can't get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever, two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we'd even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I've never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn't hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well. The only redeeming value on the flight were the more comfortable seatings and the fact that the pilot seemed experienced. My question on this flight: other than the more comfortable seats - what did I pay for? This was a very poor excuse for what was supposed to be a first class flight.",Detractor

" I flew on upgraded business class on Qatar Airways from Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha (return). What a treat!! The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets.

Business Class LHR to AKL. LHR to Hong Kong leg was with Cathay and the HK to AKL leg provided by Air NZ as code share. On the whole Cathay was superior with the exception of the food which was excellent on Air NZ. Cathay business class seating provided excellent space and storage and the configuration 1x2x1 with each seat angled away from the aisle ensured privacy. This contrasted with Air NZ which had less storage and not as much privacy as seats have lower screens and are angled towards each other. The Air NZ lie flat bed with mattress was comfortable but requiring the crew to make up the bed was an irritation. The inflight entertainment was far superior on Cathay Pacific. The Air NZ controls were very dated and the screen was small compared to other airlines. Overall service from flight crew was very good with both airlines. Disappointing that a lounge pass was not provided at check-in because of the codeshare status and I was instructed to use the Air NZ lounge at Hong Kong but on arrival discovered Air NZ shares the Thai lounge which was disappointing to say the least. Codeshare also meant that I couldn't check in on line for the non Cathay legs. I chose the code share flight combination as it offered the opportunity to experience two different business class services. Next time I would select flights only from Cathay pacific as Air NZ was disappointing. I understand that the Hong Kong to AKL route is provided by older fleet and it felt like it.,Promoter

The check in operations at the Airport was very mediocre at best. 5 hours flight with no entertainment on board not even a wireless one that you could connect your own device. Hardly any leg room across standard seats. They charge fees for checked in luggage to include carry on hand luggage.

"  18/6/2017, Zurich - Amsterdam and 21/6/2017, Amsterdam - Zurich. The flight from ZRH to AMS was about two hours late, not the Airlines fault. The return flight was on time. Both flights were comfortable, safe and a nice experience. The flight from AMS back to ZRH was extremely comfortable because it was only about half full. Both flights were about 60 to 65 minutes, so the lack of IFE does not bother me. Free Sandwich and a glass of Apple Juice. Will recommend Swiss Int'l Airlines to anyone. I paid CHF 101 all inclusive.

"FR2005, Stansted to Otopeni, Romania. This was our first flight with Ryanair and we approached it with a degree of caution and apprehension. I have to say, that these feelings were unfounded. Ryanair in 2015, simply do not deserve the reputation they have. The entire booking process was easy to understand and administer. Follow the rules and it works well and easy. The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old. I think that all Ryanair need to do now to complete their transformation to a customer friendly carrier, is make water affordable on board. Perhaps Â£1 for a 500ml bottle of water wouldn't be too much to ask?",Promoter

Sometimes, I wonder is this part of the training of United Airlines by offering this type of customer experience or it was simply the culture of UA.",Detractor
I flew in business class from Zurich to Johannesburg and back via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Their business class product for short haul was by far the best business class I have experienced in Europe. The crew were friendly and efficient the seat pitch was good and the food was absolutely great. The lounge in Istanbul is one of the nicest business class lounges I have been in. The long-haul sector to Johannesburg and back was also great. OK the seat and the inflight entertainment and not the most modern but they were well within acceptable bounds. Once again flight crews were friendly and efficient. No problems at any time with ground services. No delays and bags all delivered promptly and in good shape.,Promoter
LHR-BKK. This was my first London - Bangkok flight since the new Royal Laurel Class was introduced on this route in August. The new herringbone seat layout is ideal for the solo traveller although I am not so sure it is ideal for families as the centre aisle seats are angled to face away from each other. However I was travelling alone so a window seat was great as the seat is fitted out like your own personal shell. At 180cm tall I had no problem in stretching out on the lay flat beds and the comfort able duvet and pillow enabled a few hours of sleep. As always the cabin crew were excellent and attentive without being intrusive. The flight left 5 minutes early and arrived in Bangkok 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage handling at both ends was simple and efficient. All in all EVA have a great product at a competitive price.,Promoter
"  Flew from London to Kuwait. Huge improvement overall. A sudden leap into a completely different realm. The new 777's are beautiful, not only in terms of superb interiors that make these planes now by far the most comfortable rides in and out of Kuwait in terms of hard-product (they used to be the worst imaginable experience) but even the new livery seems to have the flight crew smiling and the pilots looking proud. The food and service on Kuwait Airways was actually always quite good, but served in the dismal surroundings that used to depress the whole experience they could not shine as well as on these recent flights on the 777 that I have had. Even the front end of their internet site now looks like its in this century. Behind the scenes there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, I am flying again tomorrow to London on the same KU flights, but the contact centre still remains as before completely uncontactable, incredibly unhelpful when you do find a way past their systems to prevent contact, and behind the much better front of their internet site their is very little you can do to manage your booking. You still find yourself being arbitrarily moved from seats you may have reserved, find it impossible to upgrade your ticket even if you are willing to pay extra to do so (clearly commerciality has not sunk in yet) and you really don't yet get the feeling that the customer matter very much. But for the considerations in the last paragraph I would, unbelievably, be giving the airline a good 7-9 rating now (compared to the 0-1 it over-deserved before) but it needs to pick up on the back-office and mid-mangement support to get there as a complete product. For this reason its probably around the same level as BA or KLM now as a 5 (even though its planes are now much better than either of the other two that operate out of Kuwait to Europe). There is really no reason it could not ultimately approach the levels of other airlines in the region as an 8/9 rated carrier.",Passive
"  Kiev to New York. Online check-in was not functioning prior to the flight. Therefore, I had no chance to choose a seat of my choice for a 10 hrs flight. When called the hotline, they advised that I'll be able to choose a seat during the airport check-in. But that was not the case either as the lady at the check-in informed me that I may not have such an option. So, I got what she gave me. When I asked for a seat next to the emergency exit, she suggested me to pay a fee for that. Ridiculous, isn't it? But the problems were just mounting. Thereafter was a 3 hrs departure delay with no customer care whatsoever. I would not fly this airline again, if they were not the only direct flight from Ukraine to New York.",Detractor

The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter.

 Birmingham to Bucharest . The baggage policy is a joke because they do not check and people bring very large bags on board. The spaces between chairs are way too small to be legal.

"  My flight from Denver to San Francisco got cancelled 8 hours prior to departure. The email was three sentences long and did not give a reason. I was upset, but just tried to see if they could put me on their afternoon flight tomorrow instead. Was on the phone to re-book my flight for 45 minutes, and when the representative finally answered, he told me the next available flight would be in 4 days! I was already upset about this and my waiting time, so while I looked at different airlines for an earlier flight, asked the rep to wait for 2 minutes. After quickly finding a better flight with Southwest, I looked at my phone and the representative had hung up! Had to recall again and wait another 30 minutes just to ask for a refund. Had to book the flight with a different airline and spent about $100 more than I needed to. Not to mention my flight coming to Denver from San Francisco earlier (this was a round-trip flight) got delayed 4 hours!

The only real negative was the sparseness of alcoholic beverages. There was no white wine and very little red wine or beer.

Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule.

"  Boston to Frankfurt return via Keflavik with WOW air. Like so many others, I was attracted by the low sticker price the airline is offering for tickets: $440 roundtrip to Frankfurt from Boston, before the holidays, seemed incredible. I did do some research ahead of time, reading up on the restrictions and reviews and thought that I had a fairly good understanding about what I was getting into. I only had carry on, correct (small size and weight), bought food ahead of time, etc. Even with this knowledge, and low expectations, the experience was pretty bad. 4 hours delay getting out of Boston. The good news was that the connecting planes tend to wait, so at least I wasn't stranded in Iceland. But because I had to get to Munich via train the overall trip took around 20 hrs or so. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes this airline so abysmal, since on paper it just sounds like any other US airline: no food, no service, delays, little communication, fee for checked luggage, etc. But everything seemed multiplied, perhaps of longer flights than domestic US flight. If you're in a position where you could take another airline (ie. it's not about whether or not you will make the trip) choose another carrier. I could see a very small subset of travelers benefitting from WOW : super flexible, forced to take it because otherwise you couldn't go, and being the type of person who doesn't get upset about much. Honestly, I thought I'd fall into that category, but don't. Won't fly them again.",Detractor

"  Our initial journey from London Gatwick to New York JFK went fairly smoothly, albeit with noticeably long (slow) queues to check in. The food was average and they asked us if we wanted extra water or coffee etc. The in-flight entertainment had a good selection, if a little limited, and the seats were extremely comfortable. Our problems began on the return journey. On arrival at JFK it was difficult to find the correct queue, so we asked a member of staff and were duly directed. Then people in the queue began talking about how they had received texts regarding their plane to Copenhagen being cancelled. I asked a member of staff about the LGW plane - it was on time. After waiting almost an hour I was informed that the flight had a 12 hour delay and that I was in the wrong queue. No apology, empathy or explanation. We then waited in the slowest queue ever, (nearly 2 hours) to be given a food voucher and told ""We'll call you in about 30 minutes when some accommodation is ready"". You've guessed, no call after nearly an hour. We then queued again (45 minutes) to be told we were going to the Radisson and to go to the shuttlebus 'downstairs'. I asked for specific directions to the bus stand and was told "" Downstairs, at Arrivals"". This information was given to me as ungraciously and rudely as possible. I felt like luggage. Outside this major international airport, I and other passengers had no idea where to meet the bus. We were moved to 3 different places. After over 1 hour we were informed that Norwegian had now contacted the Radisson and that they would soon arrive. Why wait an hour to contact them? The shuttlebus arrived in yet another area, and was in fact only a large minibus (for a hundred passengers and their luggage). You can imagine the 'dash'. At the hotel, another queue. In the morning despite an early start we had to queue for over an hour for the shuttlebus due to very high demand. At the airport, monitors showed that we should go to checkpoint H, turned out to be wrong and we needed to be at A (literally a quarter of a mile away). Then, the biggest check-in queue I have ever seen was at A. We couldn't actually get to the check in and had to queue in order to join the queue. Hours went by. Finally we boarded the plane (late) and were then delayed over an hour on the runway - (not the fault of Norwegian). The flight was fine (but didn't get the window seat which I had booked).

"Gatwick is not my first choice but for Naples with British Airways it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return Club Europe ticket for a treat. Check in fast and friendly, and fast track was amazing, we were the only people using it. The BA lounges at Gatwick have been closed and we were sent to the No 1 lounge which BA is using instead. To say it is less good is an understatement. Â£8 for a glass of champagne (whereas free in the old BA lounge) is just ridiculous. The atmosphere is more Weatherspoons than Fortnum and Mason and the crowd was noisy and chaotic. If what we were told is true (the lounge will be used until next year) we will be avoiding it next time and probably avoiding BA in that case. Food was small portions and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drinks. Once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and the afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling (disappointing after the rubbish we were served in the lounge). Return flight from Naples began with another abysmal lounge experience. Windowless, crowded and with very limited food and drink, again not worth the bother.

Wonderful service accommodation and staff throughout my journey from LAX-AKL. The VIP lounges are excellent and well stocked and the Premier Business class seats are the best lay flat seats I've travelled in. Wonderful meals and wine selections too! Koru Club in AKL is huge and has plenty of room to stretch out and drink/eat.,Promoter
Flew from Jamaica on a Boeing 767 good headroom pleasant crew but horrible placing of the 'press for service button' on the armrest meant constant and irritable sounds of sometimes very loud multiple alarms going off. Even the crew were upset and they had to put up with it going and coming! If you can fly a different airplane I will definitely avoid the 767s.,Passive
"  Hyderabad to Chicago via Delhi. My TV screen didn't work for the entire flight of 16 hours, not only mine entire 4 rows didn't work so I couldn't even change my seat. Service is bad, staff are rude and didn't respond to our complaints. Food, can't expect more from any airlines but same old.",Detractor
" Porto to Gatwick and never again! Called through to the gate on time but then waited for over an hour without being told anything by staff as to reason for delay. Finally bundled on to the plane - seats very hard and uncomfortable and onboard service terrible. ""Snack"" arrived (almost thrown at you) and cabin staff seemed surprised when I declined. My wife took hers and regretted it. During all cabin announcements there was no mention of the delay as is it was all normal. This was even worse than the flight out 2 weeks earlier when at least the crew were more friendly. Still same issue with seat comfort although different plane. The only good points were that the Check In staff for both flights were efficient and friendly. TAP have now gone to the top of my Do Not Fly list.",Detractor
" Honolulu to Los Angeles. Had the worse experience ever! I fly 5-6 times a month (not with Alaska Airlines) And this flight was so bad that I can't pass on it. Our flight attendant was very rude. We came back from Honolulu to Los Angeles and my girlfriend had a headache when we enter the plane, so I asked for a cup of water. The flight attendant said she can serve drinks only after we take off. It tonight it's the policy, but meanwhile she could sneak drinks and snacks to her girlfriend that was sitting next to us. When I complained to her, the flight attendant was rude, she ignored us and even refused to take our trash when she picked up for the rest of the passengers. After all of that, when I asked someone else from the crew for an alcoholic beverage, she said that she can't serve us any alcohol drinks (because we asked for water when we enter and it means we are sick!) I upgraded our seats to premium sitting because the drinks are included (cost me an extra $200), and we didn't get any drinks at this flight. I felt so uncomfortable and so embarrassed with the way the flight attendant treated us, and I demand will never fly with them again!",Detractor
"  Bucharest to Istanbul. I tried to submit this complaint to Tarom but as usual their website won't process it. I broke a rib on Wednesday and asked for assistance in going to the gate at OTP. The clerk told me that if she called for help for me she'd downgrade me to economy. I know that it is a primary function of airline companies to behave illogically, but this one is quite new to me. Only economy passengers are allowed to break a bone? Or is it the cost of getting disability assistance as promised on your website?",Passive
"MEL-BKK-MEL in Boeing 777. Business Lounge at Melbourne Airport (shared with Air NZ) is tatty and tired with worn dirty carpets and furnishings very poor snack selection and a general air of neglect. Outbound aircraft was a bit tatty and worn too with the customary small and hard business class seats often found on Asian airlines generally and of course they are at an angle even when ""flat"" so unless you strap yourself in firmly you will slowly slide down onto the floor. Inflight service was adequate but rushed and wine top ups had to be requested. Inflight movies and entertainment was excellent with lots of new release movies. Return flight was in a newer cleaner aircraft but the same issues with seat and service applied. Overall I'd rate Thai as ""OK"" but there are better options.",Passive
"British Airways from London Heathrow to Jeddah, took off over one hour late due to an unspecified technical issue. Economy section full. Seats generally okay, 7 inch screen provides a small selection of videos and music on demand. Food was some kind of chicken curry with a salted chocolate caramel mousse plus a roll and cheese. Close to arrival they offered a cheese croissant plus additional drinks. Alcohol available for free until around Egypt. One serious cleaning issue under seat 34c where the side of the computer box looked like it had never been cleaned hence food detritus had built up. Pleasant crew, just one extended message which was non safety related which could have been omitted.",Passive
"  London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good. Maybe I was unlucky, but my trip home was not as good as I expected.",Passive
Dec 15 2014 AC1828 and AC1876 Jan 9 2015. Terrible. Avoid at all costs. I travel quite frequently and am of reasonable height/weight. The seats are tiny and uncomfortable. Knees pressed against the seat ahead. Barely any lean back because you'd slam into the person behind you. Very small storage above. Inflight 'entertainment' didn't work. 5.5hrs to Maui. Paid top dollar. Lots of other people commented the same. Nice staff not the jaded older ones that can be found on regular AC flights.,Detractor
"  Evening flight from Leeds to Dublin on ATR 72-600. This 3 year old airplane was in immaculate condition. Departure 10 minutes early. Friendly service from two very well turned out FA's. Captain's pre flight introduction was perfunctory to the point of being rude. Didn't introduce himself, his first officer, or the FA's. Unusual for Aer Lingus, and noticed by the senior FA, who immediately followed the captain's announcement with another of his own, in which he gave us all the names. Absolutely nothing wrong with the service, flight, or anything else, but the fact that the captain followed up with a further equally perfunctory announcement grated a bit.",Passive
" Austin to Detroit. This is the absolute worst airline out there! Saving a few bucks isn't worth it. Plus, those cheap flights are never as cheap as they advertise. You have to pay for your seat, cary on, check bag, food and beverages nothing is free. I got to the terminal & no one was at the front desk. Everyone knows how frustrating it is to feel like you're going to miss a flight. Well imagine having enough time but no one is there to check your bag, which I paid $32 for. I bought a flight with Spirit because I knew I would never make it to my flight. When I get to the other terminal I see that my Frontier flight got delayed. I still could've made my 1st flight if a worker had just told us what was going on. But they left a line of like 10 people worried sick for who knows how long because I left. The difference with my second flight is that Spirit kindly canceled my flight for me & even fetched my checked bag from the room in the back & now I have a flight credit with Spirit. I tried to get a refund from Frontier & they didn't even give me a reason why. They just said no because I missed my flight.",Detractor
"British Airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from Athens to London that now means I miss a wedding that I booked 3 months ago. I, as a gold card holder, have a connecting flight to Buenos Aires on BA. Regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection. Subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island I am on. Now they have said that to rebook I need to repay - thanks BA for looking after your gold card holder so well - I highly recommend book with anyone but BA for shortfall - better with Easyjet, Ryanair, cheaper and better. If they treat Gold Card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way - good luck to economy travellers. I am embarrassed to be called a gold card member. You cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients.",Detractor

"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam. The economy plus seating is better than normal economy though although I'm not sure it compares favorably with other airlines' economy.",Passive
I my husband and child flew UIA return Manchester - Schipol - Kiev - Simferopol (KLM do the Schiphol leg). Awful service by UIA as usual on return leg. Check in at Simferopol said she couldn't print boarding passes for final leg - gave us separate seats on one leg (child is 5) and when asked to change this leg printed out the final leg passes she said she couldn't leaving us one leg short on boarding passes and not resolving the issue. We only realised when we tried to get through security at Kiev that we had the wrong passes. Took forever to get through security at Kiev and then passport control. Many people were missing flights and no one wanted to help. Finally plane was an hour late and we missed our connection - not one UIA member of crew was helpful. KLM though came to the rescue and were professional - though lost my luggage as usual. My biggest criticisms of UIA though are that food is abysmal and cabin crew seem only to be concerned with their looks not about their customer service. Overall wish never to fly with them again.,Detractor
Flight 719 on Wednesday May 28th. I tried to fly on Spirit between Denver and Las Vegas but the flight was canceled because of the absence of the crew. We spent one hour inside the aircraft itself waiting for them and finally we had to spend the night at Denver airport after 5 hours waiting at the front desk to get a solution for the next day (with another company hopefully). The quality of the service was very poor. In addition I was flying with a 7-month baby.,Detractor

This last flight was from Guatemala to Sao Paulo via Panama, I flew on a Embraer 190 from Guatemala to Panama, it was a really comfortable and short flight (one and a half hour), but the flight from Panama to Brasil, the Boeing 737-800 is a nightmare, too tight, turbulence can get nasty, the plane had a somewhat nice entertainment system but not something that would keep you busy on the 7 hours flight. Food is bad on Copa Airlines, flight attendants not always polite, 50% of the time they will not provide a blanket, they do give headphones every time.

"  Orlando to San Francisco. My trip with United was the worst experience ever. They have this new rule with no carry ons. We bought the tickets from expedia and we had no forewarning. At the check in kiosk we found out about this new rule. We checked in our carry on much to our annoyance about not receiving any previous warnings. At the gate my husband had his suit in a hanger and a backpack on him and the employees were rude and obnoxious before we even got a chance to talk. The employee immediately started baddegering us about receiving 17 alerts about no the more than one item per person rule. When we tried to explain we bought the ticket from expedia and didnt receive any warning, she went on to imply that we were lying! Another employee had to intervene and let us through (as if they were giving us a pass) This is ridiculous! Make an announcement if you are changing policies!

I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,Detractor
Flight 142 on 2 Aug and Flight 145 9 Aug. All the years that I traveled with so many different airlines I have never had this type of service and other added costs. You want water a soft drink or anything you have to pay. I made a reservation for a low cost trip from Dominican Republic to Fort Lauderdale assumed cost of the plane travel was low. Now comes the additional cost of luggage for any bag under 40 lb you pay $50 anything over that $100 carry-on $50 computer bags and other handbags $50 if its more than 18 inches high. Here is the catch I was traveling with another person that had a computer bag the same as mine he was able to go through at no cost.,Detractor
"  Great airline, only problem was the fact that we were late at least 10 minutes both ways, from Stockholm-Athens-Chania and back home to Stockholm. Had to wait in the aircraft for up to 30 minutes after we were supposed to takeoff. Seats were ok, did not expect anything better for an economy flight. TV showed short clips from all over Greece. But on the bright side, the food was the best airplane meal I have had. I ordered lacto-ovo-vegeratian and it was great. Tasted excellent. Just plain pasta, zucchini and cheese, and back home it was an omelette with cheese. Also my friends ""normal"" food was very good. We were served nice treats and drinks at appropriate times. Cabin crew were friendly, but their english could be improved, or at least talk a bit slower. You could barely hear what they were saying. For example when they explained why we were late, we only understood that it was something wrong with the aircraft.",Promoter

10 day package deal from Vancouver to Maya Riveria. This is the worst airline we've travelled - we are seasoned travelers. Purchased Elite Plus both ways. Incoming trip - advised our carry-ons were overweight. They were only allow 5kg? That's the weight of the carry-on empty practically. No special quirks for the Elite extra fees except the leg room. It's a cattle train. No personal entertainment. In fact the small little screen which pops down halfway through your trip only has static for the sound. They don't care. They keep in playing anyway with no one watching. This happened on both in and on going. When you reach Cancun be prepared to unboard then stand on tarmac waiting for them to load you in a bus to the terminal. In the heat. Be prepared to be packed in like pigs going to the slaughter with no air except exhaust fumes. Expect the same for the return trip. We were one hr late on our return trip getting us into Vancouver at 1 am. The plane was freezing on the return. The only solution was buying a $15 disposable blanket! When I suggested we paid for elite the steward said no blanket but how about a big glass of their cheap swill wine. Only way I'd load up in one of these cattle runs is if we were to be evacuated for a hurricane.,Detractor
"Six segments with Delta Air Lines (one KLM codeshare in Europe), five were on time or early and the last was unavoidably delayed due to fog. Overall a good experience. I found the A330 business class seat to be extremely comfortable. Great for reading, screen time and for napping. AVOD was satisfying, movies included some classics, some new releases and a nice selection of non-US films with subtitles. Good mellow-music channel too. The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering. Perhaps too high expectations, given all the hype about celebrity chefs and the fancy menu. The first courses (starters, soups, salads) were great, the entrees were barely OK. Likewise the desserts. Wines were good. KLM from AMS to MAD first class is economy three-across seating with nobody seated in the middle, and it probably has some extra leg room. Food was good though.",Promoter

The quality of food was excellent. On the TPE-YVR it was a treat to be served two hot meals. If there was a point lacking, it was that drinks were only offered with the meal and not prior and nor after. Perhaps one is supposed to just ask. As for flying with EVA again, I certainly would fly with them however I would do so in Premium Economy. Wonderful airline!",Promoter

I took Icelandair from Copehagen Denmark to Toronto Canada with a stop over in Reykjavik. I was very satisfied with the quality of the flight. If you look for safety control of the plane during turbulence communication pilot-passengers during important moments of the flight you make a good choice in Icelandair. If you rate the food quality the size of the seats and other superficial aspects on a flight you may not be happy but your opinion stays superficial.

The negative reviews almost prevented me from trying Spirit. I just completed my second round trip. The airline website and follow up email set expectations. If you read everything Spirit provides you will have a better experience because you'll know what to expect and expectations will be in alignment.

Frankfurt to Taipei return. On the way to Taipei I missed the connection at Beijing because the flight was delayed by two hours. At Beijing airport my luggage was missing found it eventually but that took more than one hour. At the ticket counter I was lucky to find a seat on the next flight departing the next day. The company offered to cover my accommodation expenses for the night but that was a basic hotel room to share with two other passengers. I refused their offer which I found disgusting and insulting. On the way back to Frankfurt I had to change flight twice. At every time I had to pass the immigration check to collect my luggage and check in again. Luckily I had enough time to do that. Hongzouh to Beijing was canceled. The company announced the flight was canceled two hours before the departure. Until then the flight was scheduled as normal. The reason for canceling the flight was the disruption of the air signalling system caused by the launch of a space ship. The launch was scheduled to take place at 6.30 pm. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8.00 pm. Eventually two other passengers and I managed to get the last three seats on to another flight to Beijing.

Flew BNE to MEL in December and back again. I realise Qantas is struggling against fierce competition. But it is keeping up. The aircraft's are now a bit old and really should be replaced.

"  Toronto to Pune via Frankfurt. We arrived late on the Air Canada flight from YYZ to FRA and missed our connecting Lufthansa flight to PNQ.

Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers.

They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them. They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto. We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused. We got a call from a customer service representative who told us to contact Air Canada for our issues at they had operated the flight from YYZ to FRA. A terrible experience with Lufthansa which has excellent on board service, but very bad ground customer service.",Detractor
  Worst flying experience I've ever had. Our first flight was delayed so we had to completely reschedule all our connecting flights. We made it to Houston to wait for our next flight and after waiting 2 hours our flight was delayed another 3 hours. After 8 delays/times changes for our flight and 7 hours of sitting in the airport all they did to help us was give us a $10 voucher. We asked about the delays to try to figure out what was going on and see if there was another option. We were responded to very rudely and disrespectfully any time a question was asked and were not given any sort of response besides â€œcan't help youâ€. I will never be flying United again.,Detractor
Absolutely the worst airline operating today. On my flight to DFW from Las Vegas I guess the flight attendants were having a bad day because none of them smiled and they were rude. Granted everyone has a bad day every now and then but this flight crew were rude and snobby. Prior to boarding the plane the desk attendant called for boarding zone 1 but 5 seconds later made an announcement for all boarding which created a cluster because now everyone was in line. Returning to Vegas was just as bad although the plane we were on experienced delays due to repairs. I think I'll just stick with Southwest Airlines for my economy flights.,Detractor
"  Palma de Mallorca to Barcelona. I've flown with Air Europa four times this week, and all four flights have been 2-2.5 hours delayed. They offer no water or explanation.

I checked with Spirit about an hour after our supposed departure and agent informed us of the delay. Asked why this was not announced, he said that it would be done after the previous flight departs. I was told the reason for the delay was crew shortage, this is unbelievable that such a huge airline does not have accommodation for crew shortage.",Detractor

"JetBlue used to be a great airline 5-10 years ago but now they should be avoided. JetBlue requires you to pay for your first checked bag and even more for the second bag. I kept my bag below 50 pounds, had accepted dimensions, and they still charged me an extra $50 each way because it was traveling with unaccepted sports equipment. As I am writing this they have announced that the plane needs maintenance and there will be a delay. This has become a regular occurrence for this airline. I fly jetblue very often and their quality deterioration over the years is pathetic.",Detractor
Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies. There should be no charge for that as it should be complimentary since snacks sandwiches and alcohol are charged to the customer.,Promoter
"  I chose seat 6J for both the trip from Boston to Gatwick and back. Seats are roomy and comfy, loved the touch screen. Could have more video choices, but it was fine since we left so late at night on the way out, and I had a great seat mate on the way home. Loved the windows, and watching the plane progress on the touchscreen. The service was very friendly. Food was okay - I would have liked to have had a choice of meal (I chose Kosher and they brought out a box of food - gave my salmon to my seat mate on the way home and he loved it.) There was a ton of food in the boxes, just not a lot of stuff that I like to eat . Will definitely book with Norwegian again!",Promoter
"Flew from Heathrow to Delhi in April this year. Cabin staff lack Professionalism. They hardly smile and seem frustrated as they have to serve passengers. There is no sense of customer service. Saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the passengers. The only question they ask ""veg or non veg"" without any ""Please"". Air India has to improve service to get competitive. The food was horrible. The toilets were disgraceful. The entertainment systems are broken and slow.

"  London Heathrow to Accra via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. The first thing I noticed was that this was not a real business class. It was the normal three seats, but the middle seat no one was allowed to sit. I could not fathom not having any inflight entertainment. The flight was delayed from London for 2 hours, we sat on the runway waiting to move with not even a choice of water while we waited. We therefore arrived in Lisbon 2 hours late and therefore missing my connecting flight. While in Lisbon it was utter confusion as no one knew where to go. TAP in their infinite wisdom scheduled another flight for us on Royal Air Maroc without telling us. Our baggage went missing and we had to go to Lost and Found to locate our luggage. One of the rudest people I have ever met in Lost and Found told us we had to wait anywhere from half our to an hour while they locate our luggage, which would be sent to the baggage area. While we waited we had to stand as there were no chairs. When we asked Lost and Found if they could speed the process as we might miss the new connecting flight, the rude staff said ""you have to wait"" as she continued looking at her computer screen. While we waited for the new flight and airline, TAP did not offer us any food or drinks while we waited. I however thank them for the change of airline Royal Air Maroc, as they were much better than TAP Portugal.",Detractor

"  Emirates customer service has certainly dropped their game since I last flew with them a few years ago. An overnight flight from Barcelona to Dubai - simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. This is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from Sydney to Dubai (to which they answered they do as its 'long haul'). Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one. I'll stick to Qatar Airways in future when flying from Australia abroad, far superior service.",Detractor
 Copenhagen to Munich. Lufthansa does not offer a fast lane at Copenhagen Airport for Business Class or star alliance Gold. That was quite inconvenient and the regular security took more than 20 minutes. SAS Lounge is not that good. Gate area old and dark and far a away. Flight on Lufthansa Cityline was uneventful. Crew was okay. No WiFi or entertainment. Considering that the flight was operated by a regional jet the seats were spacious and reclined. Verdict: good airline. CPH is not good.,Passive

"Mexico City to Melbourne via Houston and LAX. Worst airline I have ever flown and I am not the type to leave negative reviews. Firstly our flight from Melbourne to LAX boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 4 hours due to 'computer failures'. Finally we took off, and an enormous amount of water poured through the aircraft ceiling and landed on a passenger near me, soaking her completely. We missed our connection from LA to Mexico City and were put on another flight. On the way home things really got bad. We had booked a flight from Mexico City to Melbourne with one connection in LA. We received an email from United saying they had changed our itinerary to Mexico City - Houston - LA - Melbourne, with no explanation. There were also very short transfer times in each airport. Of course, we missed our connection in Houston (where we were also instructed by United to pick up our bags and recheck them, which was ridiculous given the timeframe), and then were put onto another flight from Houston to LA, which gave us 20 minutes in LA to make our flight to Melbourne or else we would be stuck there for another day. When we asked if we would be provided with a hotel, we were told ""Sorry, none of this is our fault"". We rushed and somehow made the flight to Melbourne in 20 minutes, which was incredibly stressful. Arrived home thinking it was all over, and they had lost one of our bags. Worst customer service given the repeated inconveniences.",Detractor
" San Francisco to Dublin via ReykjavÃ­k. I was aware of the extra charges many reviewers have commented on in their reviews. Therefore, when booking I could clearly see the true cost and was aware of additional fees. For two people (My wife and I) we paid â‚¬750 for a one way ticket from San Francisco to Dublin with a short stopover in Reykjavik. This included check in luggage up to 20Kg, carry on luggage (10 Kg) and a personal item (rucksack, handbag). This was more than sufficient and the extra fees paid for this luggage allocation are included in the â‚¬750. The flight from SFO- ReykjavÃ­k was on the Airbus A330 aircraft with a flight time of 8 hrs. Although the leg room was tight, it was by no means uncomfortable, once you took a regular stretch or walk as you should do on any airline. Limited food menu was available onboard. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The one negative was that the universal charge points beneath the seat were not working, however, the staff obliged by charging in their rest area. After a short stopover in Reykjavik we boarded a new Airbus A321 to Dublin and this plane had all the modern comforts of a brand new aircraft. Although we had to pay for food onboard both flights, the difference between travelling with Wow and Aer Lingus was saving in the region of â‚¬800 for two people with the stopover adding 2.5-3hrs to the journey. I found the stopover good to break up the journey and this may suit families travelling with children or those who value their Cash at the expense of a few extra hours travel. Overall a very positive experience.",Promoter
DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself.,Passive

First Class lounge at Heathrow Airport is a sheer delight, peaceful, very few passengers and excellent breakfast. It was such a lovely experience - champagne, food and full attention to me.

Turned up early for the outbound flight at LHR and was immediately asked if I wanted to be bumped up to the earlier departure to DUB, which I was grateful for as I had a fairly tight connection and was transiting via US Pre-clearance there. I was impressed by the standard of amenities onboard and the professionalism of all crews. The food was of a very good standard, better than most I've tried and the crews on both long haul sectors ensured that beverages and some snacks were also available at all times from the galley. IFE on the A330's is excellent, works really well and has a wide selection of content. All of the aircraft were clean, modern and comfortable. Would definitely recommend Aer Lingus.",Promoter

We arrived at CDG in plenty of time, one and a half hours before the flight, only to be told we were late. My son's French is very good and heard the check in staff discussing how their website is rubbish and it was saying the flight was closed as it was quoting the wrong take off time.

We had to sit separately. On arriving at LHR I got an email and text explaining my luggage had not been loaded.

I used United in the past for domestic flights in the US and it was average I thought it would be fine to use them to travel abroad. Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price. Other airlines give full service for about the same price!,Detractor
"  I frequently fly to Europe from LA every month and a half, and always choose Norwegian. They are the equivalent of Southwest in a European, low-cost carrier. It's super easy to fly with them, with their cheap prices and ease of changing flights. I always fly economy and buy the package of a bag and a meal, and I find it to be very comfortable. With their friendly staff and easy check-in, I've never had any problems with Norwegian. The food is decent (you get what you pay for), but their in-flight entertainment system is excellent, on my flight to London from LAX in March they already had LaLa Land! They have plenty of movies and shows to keep you entertained for hours, and on the short flight from London to Helsinki they had free wifi. Since I'm a frequent flier I usually check-in 2 bags (sports equipment), and have never had a problem. I also change my return date frequently since my schedule is always changing, and have only had to pay 90 euros to 100 euros, but never more than that. Plus I'm a Norwegian rewards member so I get cashpoints for flights, hotels and lounge access, which you can apply towards any flight right away (no needing to wait until you get 30k points to use towards a flight, you can use it instantly). Either I can wait a couple months and get a couple hundred dollars off, or I can use it the next month and get $20 off. Norwegian is easy and I'll continue to fly with them.",Promoter

"  I greatly regretted booking my flight from New York to Madagascar on South African Airways. While this was the most direct route, the headaches and hassles associated with South African's booking system and web services were extensive. As a result, we spent hours trying to do such simple tasks as obtain seats, and had to spend 2 lengthy sessions on the phone with customer service, only to arrive at JFK with the problems unresolved. It is a pity that one of the leading carriers of Africa cannot run a basic website.

Service was delivered by hand with nice touches like post take off Cava and a tablecloth.

" Stockholm to Bangkok via Helsinki and my flights to and from BKK were delayed. The service onboard was good but the customer service at the customer care center is non existent. You have to contact them several times before they answer back. Upon my arrival at the airport to check in I received a message that my flight was delayed. No one informed me about my rights according to the EU's legislation. Glad that I knew about it. I contacted Finnair regarding this but they made it very difficult to find the right form to fill in. Unlike for example British Airways where you can find the form easily and they compensate you within a few days. My flight was delayed on Dec 21 and all I got from Finnair is ""I'm going to investigate to find out what happened and will get back to you."" I know what happened, all I want is my compensation that I am entitled to. Also, I got to the airport in HEL to catch my flight but I ended up standing in line for an hour because the passport controls were not open. In the end I only had 10 minutes left before boarding and I did not get to use the lounge at HEL. Like I said, the service onboard was good. The flat bed on A330 was nice and I managed to get a good sleep. Business class cabin was not too crowded which was good. Finnair provides wifi service onboard that costs about â‚¬20 for the entire flight unless you are a Finnair plus gold card holder, then it's free. The internet was very slow so on the way back I just used my 1-hour complimentary wifi because I just thought it was not worth paying for. The IFE is ok, not so many good movies to choose from.

We flew Air Canada for years because we knew we could depend on a pleasant experience and a comfortable ride - a far cry from your typical charter. On a recent trip to the Caribbean on AC rouge we were treated to incredibly uncomfortable and cramped seats a dingy and dirty interior a flaky electrical system (lights on lights off like magic if the lights worked at all) and an unreliable entertainment system (maybe you can watch a movie maybe we'll be having bandwidth allocation problems and you won't be able to). We brought our own devices for the entertainment system but there is no charging capability. How handy. And the light switches are on the arm rest so my neighbour's elbow was also quite efficient at turning it on and off unexpectedly. The flight was late both directions didn't seem to be weather related. Nobody made their connection on the way back forcing them to stay overnight. So no incentive to choose AC again that's for sure. We were always willing to pay a bit more in the past. Now we might as well go with any low-quality discount airline. Apparently they are all the same.,Detractor
"  Tel Aviv to Kaunas. The departure was from the smaller terminal 1 at Ben Gurion airport. Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time. Since this is a low cost airline my expectations were not very high, but I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again, especially since they have lots of interesting destinations that no one else flies to.",Passive

Paphos - LGW 11th June. We had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from BA to confirm this. We arrived at Paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. BA had 3 check in counters open one of which was for Club Europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. We had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. I then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. After 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. The food options were OK but again not a great choice for veggies. The flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. We were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat underwhelming.,Passive
"  London to Dubrovnik. Interesting that BA have dropped the ""to fly to serve advert"" Boarding was the usual unorganised shambles. Selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads. No less than three couples came on with oversized bags. In one instance, it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads, coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers. When complaints were made to cabin crew, the response was ""they are entitled to bring hand luggage"" The trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. Most of the choices were unavailable. Cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders, and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system.. Would strongly recommend taking own food on BA short haul flights.",Detractor

"This was my first flight to Europe in Premium Economy. I have flown Premium Economy to Asia with Qantas and BA but 8 hours is a lot different to 24 hrs. The width of the Cathay Pacific premium economy seat and armrest are big enough that you do not touch the person next to you and do not feel restricted when eating. I had a bulkhead to HKG and it is the best option but the leg rest is a little short - putting my cabin bag on the floor overcame that issue. To Paris I was one row back, so only had the foot rest but it was still okay. When the seat in front is on full recline there is still plenty of room. 8 inches of recline doesn't sound much but combined with the seat width it is surprisingly good enough to get some good sleep. There is separate boarding for PE and this works well and they make it very clear that you are not in Economy. A glass of champagne before take-off is always nice. I read reports that cabin staff can be absent during the flight. and to a degree that's right, but they are very friendly and efficient. If you request something via the call button they are quick to respond so I was happy. IFE is as good as anyone else. Its not Business Class, but that does not mean its uncomfortable or basic. The Premium Economy cabin is curtained off from economy so you do feel a little privileged but get brought down to earth each time you have to share the Economy toilets. I got off the flight feeling fresh, which to me, was a compliment to the product. I think the Qantas seat and environment on the A380 (not the 747) is slightly better but its only marginal. Cathay Pacific nudges ahead of BA by a similar small margin. You wouldn't be unhappy with PE on any of the carriers but what I think what makes Cathay Pacific Premium Economy of choice is that, apart from a quality product, they have priced it ""on the money"" and this puts them ahead of Qantas. If you've got an appropriate tier status with Oneworld you get to use Business or First Class Lounges en route and the CX ones are very good (particularly The Wing in HKG) which adds to the overall comfort of the flight.",Promoter

"Sydney to Kolkata via Singapore. If it's Singapore Airlines then it's perfect. I have travelled on Emirates, Qatar, British Airways, Thai Airways, you name it. Over all these airlines I love Singapore Airlines. I travelled on a Airbus A380 from Sydney to Singapore and trust me they have the best seats and best food around. It was a pretty long flight and I never felt bored, to be honest I wanted to spend a little more time on the A380. Later that day I had a connecting flight to Kolkata. I spent a bit of my time at the lounge which was splendid. I was 10 mins away from missing my flight because I almost forgot what time it was when I was at the lounge. The flight to Kolkata was a red eye and pretty tiring one, but I asked the flight attendant if she could serve me hot chocolate after I wake up. Surprising just after I woke up she came to me and did her duty, and she even asked me if I wanted some food. If you're flying Business or even Economy it's got to be SIA!",Promoter

And after spending 40 mins on the phone to them they offered to change us all (myself, wife & 2 kids) to the flight that evening for nearly â‚¬2000. I kept calm and decided to go alone at a charge of â‚¬303 having to leave my wife and 2 kids to follow the next day. They said if I provide a Death Cert they'd return the change fee.

"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again.",Detractor

My partner and I arrived at the airport for our flight from Rome to Barcelona only to discover that with Ryanair you are required to check-in online or be charged at 45 euro fee per passenger! This wouldn't have been an issue if it were clearly stated in the confirmation email they sent when we booked, however it was only make clear in an email sent to us shortly before the flight. As we were travelling we had limited email access (which I feel is far from unusual when people are travelling). This is a pretty cynical way of extorting extra fees from their customers, as they know that a certain percentage of people will not receive the eleventh hour email and be forced to pay the fee or be stranded. We were arrived an hour and a half before our flight and they still wanted 45 euros to print two pieces of paper! The planes were unclean, staff rude, and the service horrible.",Detractor

We use easyJet regularly from Bristol and I'm always amazed that we have wait ages in the departure gate. This trip was no exception. The plane had been standing there overnight so it should have been ready but no we had to wait (standing) for the best part of thirty minutes before being allowed to board. Sheer bloody lack of consideration. When we eventually boarded the captain informed us that there would be a delay because they needed an engineer to come and update the maps for BCN airport. Again the plane had been standing there overnight surely the maps could have been updated then. Then to cap it all a passenger who had checked in had failed to turn up so we had a further delay whilst they found and removed their bags (admittedly not EJs fault). The flight itself was uneventful and the landing at BCN was one of the best (smoothest) we've experienced in many years. We will continue to use easyJet but they really should be more professional when it comes to boarding.,Passive
Madrid -Zurich A319. First big disappointment is that when you want to check-in online you can not select anymore a seat and the system by default assigns you a middle seat. If you want to select your seat you have to pay an additional EUR15â‚¬ - pure rip off! The seats on the planes are cramped closely together. Food is only available against payment (and expensive) not even a glass of water is served free of charge!

" I have flown with Air China for the third time and this will be my last. Service is terrible. Flight attendants were rude at times. Food is also terrible. Since it's first come first served, there is no guarantee you can choose what meat you prefer since it will run out. The rice is always bad, so sticky and the noodles are not better. People (and flight attendants) will speak Chinese to you if you are Asian and mostly will continue to do so even when you tell them you are not Chinese. Transiting in Beijing is also a terrible experience. If you don't know where to go, even if you ask they are not very happy and look very annoyed that you asked. Or worse, just shouted at you in Chinese and pointed to somewhere. The time of transit is very short, which you will easily miss your next flight (more troubles). The last thing I am most frustrated about is, at the end of the flight, you will likely lose your luggages. Happened a few times already. And when it does, you have to wait at least 3 days for it to delivered (very late at night). So, never again.",Detractor

TK 2421 Antalya to Istanbul August 11. TK 66 Istanbul to Jakarta August 12. We have always enjoyed TK and have flown it many places around the world each time in Business Class. There does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the 330 vs 777 airplanes. The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrÃ©e that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,Passive

Sydney-London-Melbourne on A380 with a family group of six ranging from grandparents (includes me) to parents to two 11 year old grandchildren. Originally booked QF9/10 from/to Melbourne but QF9 was cancelled some months prior to departure apparently as an occasional cost-saving measure by Qantas. Hence we were moved to QF1 from Sydney for the outbound leg with a domestic connecting flight in Business. Overall an excellent experience that includes the chauffeur transfer services spa and massage facilities at the First Lounge in Sydney personal escort to the aircraft warm friendly and genuine personal greetings by all cabin staff and Customer Service Managers on each leg great menu options top wines and spirits good entertainment facilities spacious individual suites and very comfortable beds. All staff were magnificent - efficient cheerful always checking if anything else could be done and they had great fun interacting with the children (and vice a versa). The only downside that prevents me from giving full star ratings overall was a couple of us had to queue for the toilets a couple of times because they were being used by Business Class passengers from upstairs. Obviously a legacy from when Qantas decided to replace two of the Business Class toilets upstairs with seats. I'm sure someone in the Qantas executive could identify a simple solution to this annoyance. In summary Qantas can be very pleased with the manner in which all staff looked after us.,Promoter
"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",Passive

"  Check-In at Ho Chi Minh City was fast with my boarding-pass printed out already. Got special assistance to get through passport and security-checks. Very friendly staff. Welcome on board was warm and efficient, the food and beverage manager even remembered me from an earlier flight. My seat was changed from window to a center-seat without even informing me. Seat (business-class) very narrow and under par from key competitors with a 50/50% divide of seat and a 'side-table' (where the guest behind puts his feet for sleeping). No head-rest cover (unhygienic). No amenity kit any more for a long haul overnight flight (staff informed me that they discontinued offering them). Eat-when-you-like option is nice but dinner is served on a tray like in economy-class. Flight crew were efficient and friendly throughout the flight. Bad sleep because of no eye-shades offered.

My lunch-choice was not available, yet they managed to get it for me. Again no amenity-kits. One of the bathrooms was wet and dirty, so better to keep your shoes on (I didn't) because of lack of slippers. Couldn't sleep because of day-flight and no eye-shades offered. Could not freshen up before landing because no razor-set or even a tooth-brush offered. Arrived Frankfurt on time. My verdict: while service at Etihad is still excellent the seats in business-class are small and uncomfortable because of bad design and the airline seems to cut costs by lowering its standards in business-class.",Detractor

I asked for a bottle of water and was told due to cut backs it was one bottle per person per trip but they could refill it. Breakfast, I was told off by the stewardess who was super stressed during the flight, because I did not eat my corn flakes which she had to tell another passenger she could not have so I could eat them! My god, I paid over $7000 for a seat on this airplane to be told off because I did not eat my corn flakes! The bathrooms were so small I did not even bother to change my clothes not only because I could not move but there was either water or urine on the floor. Maybe I am spoiled as I have flown business with Qatar Airways and Emerites and they are spacious planes with stewards that are not stressed with big bathrooms that are cleaned regularly and a menu that when you ask for something that's is on the menu you are not told you will be waitlisted.

To my surprise, he didn't even turn back to say sorry. He might not have realized that he ever hit me!

During the transfer in Shanghai we realised the boarding pass issued was different and tried to seek support from the local staff because my wife was 6 months pregnant and we in no way intended to wait 12 hours at this airport. This experience was traumatic and mostly unsuccessful : almost no english speaking staff in the entire airport - mostly lack of interest in the problem. After being sent from desk to desk for hours to only meet obviously annoyed staff from china Eastern airline we decided to wait for the given flight. As a result we had to wait 12 hours in this unpleasant airport and reached our destination with a delay of 12 hours.",Detractor
" All the reviews are dead on. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6.00, we were informed via email 18 minutes prior to check in the flight would be delayed 6 hours and 45 minutes. After calling and speaking to a Frontier Representative (who was very difficult to understand) she said they were just made aware of the delay! The delays had been going on from the day (yesterday) before. It's obvious they are diverting flights for the super bowl to reep the monetary benefits and leaving others customers hanging. Our family of 6 was going to Disney & had prepaid for park passes ($500+/day) for everyday. We are losing 90% of the day. That was the whole reason we booked such an early flight. They were not willing to do anything but refund our tickets, we are still out $500 for the first day of park passes. Had they informed us an hour earlier we could have switched flights and flown out of Trenton, NJ and had the same departure and arrival. We didn't save any money it actually cost us $500 extra by flying Frontier. They were willing to do absolutely nothing other than refunding our flight. They will not offer reduced ticket prices or future tickets (not that I would use them at this point). They are completely complacent, show a lack of respect and appreciation for their customers.",Detractor
IST-CAI-BKK-CA-IST. There is a big difference with Egyptair on their new 777 aircraft and the old 737's. So IST to CAI was a complete mess people with so much baggage in their laps arguments over taking over people's seats and the check in process was insanity personified. Instead of sending everyone away to re- pack their bags they make you wait as people do it at the check in desk. And you wait and then you wait some more because every other person on these flights into CAI is carrying way too much baggage and trying to sneak it in. I was dreading the 777 to BKK but lo and behold it's like a different airline! Modern clean and bright plane crew in complete control of the cabin. Amazing difference. Same on the return. Not sure I would do it again on MS flights although my time in the three cities was great.,Passive
LHR-LIS-FAO return. All flights left about 10-30 minutes late yet the time was always made up in flight. Seats are quite comfortable and I would recommend row 24 on A321 as it is exit seat with extra room. Food served is average usually a cold sandwich apart for on LIS-LHR where due to a crew shortage no food or drinks could be served throughout the flight. TAP is a good option against the LCC when going to Europe as they offer competitive rates and include all meals and baggage. It must be said that their Lisbon hub is not the best due to the lack of signs and long walks between gates when transferring.,Passive

On our way back on the 9th of may, we went to check our bags as we were told. But were asked to pay â‚¬20 each. The lady said this is Malta not London i dont know what you were told there.

" Absolutely terrible service and we will never be flying with you guys ever again. We called the night before to make sure everything was okay with the flight and it was. However, when we get to the airport which is 2 hours away from where we live we get a call once we are at the airport that the flight was cancelled. So, we think that we will just be getting on another flight so we will still be able to get to our destination that day. We stood in line to check in for about 35 minutes and then the person there, after failing to put in our confrontation code 3 times, told us that our flight has been rescheduled for tomorrow and that we might not even be able to get on that flight. I'm really disappointed in United Airlines in their lack of communication. We weren't even told why the flight was canceled. They wasted our time and lost our business. Not that they truly care but my mother's family who were suppose to pick her up took the day off work and my mother, who hasn't seen her family for many years now, is forced to go back home and wait because United Airlines can't get their priority's straight.

Flight 103 on October 14. We flew from London to Calgary Alberta - a long cramped ride. It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything.

LHR to Kabul return. Outbound excellent check-in and very impressive Gulf Air lounge. Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast.

On our flight to Larnaca the FA's had a terrific attitude , were courteous and the cabin service director was professional and polite. The older type seating is far more comfortable than the new slimline seating adopted but still only just bearable after nearly 5 hrs of sitting.

"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination.

This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation.

I was on BA 835 from Dublin to LHR on 25th July 2014 which left Dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that I had sufficient time to connect with my flight from LHR to Hong Kong. On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3.

Seat pitch is not among the best but acceptable. But standard, not delivery, of food service is slightly below competitor's. Not much to expect of food on an economy flight but the food seems extremely economized compared with competitors. My seat was well-located but I had no choice of my preferred main course. The meal was the lowest cost option, no bottled water, and bread was served well after the meal by the time when you have finished eating. The food is domestic Chinese, for example the salad is beans in a sauce with seasame oil which suits me but doubtful if for foreigners. Good that the Chinese tea is decent.

QF15 BNE-LAX with an onward connection to SEA with AS on Friday the 14th March onboard a B747-400. The overall experience was above satisfactory on this 13 hour transpacific flight. The service was that of what you would expect from a full-service carrier starting from the ground at BNE. Excellent seat designs and seat pitch. The Economy Class food was a choice from three and these were premium selections and were considerate towards passengers with special dietary needs such as vegetarian. Premium selection of alcohol wine and soft drinks and with every hour the cabin crew did drink rounds. A snack bar was provided for passengers at the rear of the aircraft. The In-Flight Entertainment had ample choice of videos but their audio selections weren't as great as Virgin Airline's RED. Cabin crew were polite and civilized towards passengers. However I was scrutinizing the tiny details that would have made the flight truly exceptional compared to its competitors. The check-in personnel at BNE could not fully advise me on the cutoff time to drop bags with its codeshare partner Alaska Airlines. Qantas did not play any cabin music during boarding which would have set the ambience. No amenity kits were handed out for Economy PAX. The toilets were kept clean but had only basic toiletries (hand soap). No in-seat power for your electronic devices. Some TV channels on the IFE did not stream and there were no onboard internet.

The flight itself was uneventful and the staff was fairly pleasant. Oh, not even so much as complimentary water in flight. You will pay for any and all refreshments. Luckily I only had a 2 hour non stop flight but I will probably not be choosing this airline again. I will gladly play a little extra for piece of mind!",Detractor
" Portland to Nashville via Baltimore. I am disappointed in this airline and never going to fly with them again. In the past few years that I've flown with Southwest, 2/3 of my flights have been delayed. Today, they delayed my flight so much that I can not make my connecting flight. The placed me on one of the latest flights to get to my final destination. Instead of a four hour travel time, I am now looking at 9+ hours. They couldn't even place me on a different airline for an earlier flight. Not impressed at all.",Detractor
I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,Detractor
"I have no idea how Air Canada rates as one of the best airlines in North America. We flew business class and my head phones didn't work. They offered me some sort of points. But the real problem was my luggage tagged, ""priority"", came off last. I waited 45 minutes while all the luggage was unloaded and my ride home drove endlessly around the airport. Last luggage down on the carousel. I tried to contact them today on their ""chat line"" and no one seems to be working there as I waited 30 minutes without anyone answering.

"  Manila to Gatwick via Hong Kong. My flight from Manila was supposed to depart at 21.15 but was late due to bad weather.

By the time we arrived at HK there were just 35 minutes to catch my flight to London, I had to run to get to the internal security which was at the wrong end of the airport (had to take an internal train), when I got through to my horror the gate was a good 15 minutes away, again I had to rush to the gate, no time for lounge, made it with just a few minutes spare. I am not annoyed since this was not Cathay Pacific fault. From HKG to London, the flight was very comfortable and as I said before this A350 is so superior in so many ways. But I was not happy, I am in Business class and there were only two choices of meals and I could not eat either of them, ended up having starter, bread and cheese, I am sorry but this is not good enough, I paid a hefty price and to only have two choices of meals just because it is supper only. Slept well but was hungry. Simple solution email premium passenger giving us a choice of food to reserve on the flight. There is wi-fi but I chose not to use it.",Promoter

Seatbelt signs were often left on even when turbulence was nonexistent or minimal, but had no trouble using the lavatories anyway.

I arrived at the airport 5 hours before the flight since I had to check out of my hotel anyway. But then I had to wait until about 2.5 hours before departure before I was allowed to actually check my bag in, so I ended up spending a long time just sitting at the airport.",Promoter
"  Flew from Riga to Brussels. Overall, airBaltic is a budget airline with premium pricing. I have to fly with them, because there are no alternatives. Uncomfortable seats with very limited leg space and short headrests, squezeed as close as possible, rather overpriced and greasy food, although sometimes there are pleasant surprises. Aircraft always parks in the furthest possible slot, often buses are used and these cases the absolute minimum of them, so the buses are always overcrowded.

" San Francisco to Newark. Virgin America used to be my preferred airline because they used to be very good with their service, even if their price sometimes is higher than others. But this time was different, flight attendants had bad attitude, took them forever to get some water, and I was forced to paid $50 for a worthless kennel by their staff (I never had problems with my original kennel before). That kennel could barely fit my dog, My poor dog (sized small) had to sat in that little piece of junk from San Francisco to Newark. The staff even said if I don't get their kennel then I have to wait for their next flight. If I did not have to go to work the next day I would take it to their office to make it right. However, this will be my last business with Virgin America. So good luck to whoever flying with their pet by Virgin America.",Detractor

Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.,Passive
"  London Heathrow to Larnaca. British Airways was once the flagship airline of the UK, you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest. Now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches - they even charge for water and if you don't have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they don't take cash.

"Copenhagen to Riga, and SAS Scandinavian is simply terrible. It says something about the airline when one can say that even Aeroflot is better at looking after their customers. SAS charged me extra for an overweight bag, which they didn't even deliver to the final location. While I was trying to locate any person to speak with who could help, the inhumane and terrible attitude of the employees to whom I had to speak to was out of this world. I never was spoken to so rudely by people to whom I'm paying money. Ultimately, the airline never refunded the overweight charge for the bag which they never delivered to the final destination - even after almost an hour an a half I spent sending someone to Kastrup so they could find anyone who could answer my questions and find where the bag was. I've never had a good experience flying SAS, but after this brazen and immoral act of theirs, I am sure I will never fly SAS.",Detractor

" Paphos to Stansted. More than 3 hours delay. Boarded on time, then informed about a delay and then sent back to the airport gate. We were put in another aircraft and we left after 3 hours. Arrived in London and waited for the baggage for more than 40 minutes to arrive at the belts. All the people from other Ryanair flights were piling up, waiting for the belt number announcement to reclaim their baggage. Most of them had been waiting for 30 minutes already. Ryanair did not give any information, just blamed Swissport! Also, there were 100s pieces of left luggage from the previous day in front of Ryanair's baggage information desk, adding to the total chaos! Total delay for me was 3h45', which costed me to miss all my evening. Ryanair sent through an email stating 2h54' delay. However, the official departure and arrival information, states 2h59' delay. Someone is not telling the truth. Compensation is given for 3h and more. Of course they want to avoid refunds to their customers even if they are actually entitled to 0 which does not make me or my family and friends confident and keen to travel with them again.

" The airport we arrived at Midway at 11:30 and I saw there was a flight at 1:05 leaving for Cincinnati and I went and asked if I could get on it. Originally told that there may be a fee but she called someone and said wait right. She said closer to flight time we are going to be looking for volunteers anyway as your flight is overbooked. So she said if you wait close to 1:00 I can move you and give you $800 credit per ticket too, but be patient. So I was waiting and when it came time and got close I then saw a shift change and they were talking and the original worker said they are right there. Then the plane was almost boarded and she said are you needing something. I told her we are the Cincinnati couple her response was looking me dead in the face and said o we don't do that. So I left nicely and then time for our flight came and she then asked me to move to a 10:00 pm flight instead of 3:00 and if I take it now I would get the vouchers still if not I might get kicked off this flight anyway. Excuse me but I tried to help you and keep you from having empty seats in the air but you told me you don't do that. Now you are threatening to bump me. Now I have filed multiple complaints with this company and they have told me sorry their employees should know better and they will work on their training tools and also that I am not a high enough tier for them to worry about.

"I've been a loyal EVA customer for about 5 years, travelling approx three times a year to Thailand from London in both economy and premium. Prices are good and the flight times are perfect on each leg. I'd still recommend EVA but feel the quality of service has dropped. The planes on this route are starting to look a little tired inside. Films and music could be better. The food is never great on EVA and you are made to feel like you are begging for alcoholic beverages. The main issue tho is the quality of some passengers, maybe down to recent competitive prices. Noisy and rude, talking all night and opening blinds during sleep hours. The stewardesses for some reason will never ask these disruptive passengers to be quiet or close the blinds, so we all suffer light in the cabin/lack of sleep. So I'm back on Thai Airways on the Monday nightflight for the first time in 5 years, let's see how they compare.",Passive
"  Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I purchased the tickets through Expedia and almost canceled the reservation shortly after. The fare is about $20 less per ticket than the next one. More importantly, its departure time and nonstop 6 hour flight was ideal. Little did I know, as soon as I booked and paid, a link directed me to a site for seat selection. Spirit charge $12 or more to select a seat and only allow a free carry on size 18x14x8. Add the luggage fee, there is no saving to fly low budget. I called Expedia asking to cancel this booking and was informed I had to contact Spirit directly. Of course, it is not possible to talk to anyone there. We arrived the gate 40 min before scheduled departure time and learned the flight was delayed 54 min. With no flight at the gate and the posted time unchanged, we decided to get food. More than a half hour before the posted departure time, we returned to the gate and found it closed, no agent there and flight was leaving in 10 min. The departure time was changed to 22 min earlier than last posting. When the agent reappeared, those of us missed the flight were told there will be no refund of any shape and form, no help from Spirit to find other airlines and the best they can do is to fly us 48 hours later. The answer to our question on why such short notice of changed time is â€œthere is delay between the time we know and the time shows on the screensâ€. I did not know the existence of Spirit before this event and wish I had never seen its logo on Expedia site. Spirit is hard on your wallet and bad for your health.",Detractor

Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight.

"  We expected to arrive in Dubai by 0015 and board our onward flight to Kuwait by 0145. Our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from London Heathrow on 31st march, but departed at 1520.

As we arrived in Dubai at 0100, we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays. We chose this flight due to the short connection. If we wanted a longer layover, we would have booked it, but timing was important to us.

AKL-HKG and return. A340 both ways. Have not flown this route or airline for many years but had very good memories of past flights sadly this appeared to be a different airline altogether. Boarding was rather disorganised seemed to be totally at random. Crew seemed very eager to serve lunch after 1.30pm takeoff rapidly cleared trays ordered window shutters closed then disappeared for rest of flight. Only way to get a drink was to go to end of the aircraft and ask for one. No mid flight water or service was offered. Inflight movie selection was very dated and certainly not current. Old style corded remote. Could put up with all of the above but could not tolerate the seats the worst seat I have ever used in my entire life tolerable for 1-2 hours then agony fortunately seat back did not recline into your face but strange cushion arrangement which allows the seat cushion to move forward leaving no lower back support and a terrible slouching position. Totally useless had to ram pillows and blankets behind my back for some meagre support. If I had known how bad this would be I would certainly not have flown this airline. Fortunately I had an aisle seat and could easily get up and walk a little. Meals were usual economy fare just barely edible but nothing to rave about. Return flight from HKG started with a circus HK locals with seats all over the economy section boarded early and just grabbed seats in pairs regardless of seat numbers on their tickets. I had booked an aisle seat in row 32 6 months ago and boarded almost last on the plane my seat was long taken by someone whose seat was way back this rippled all the way through the front of economy and ended with 6 pax stranded at the front of economy with their seats taken cabin crew refused to move anyone and told us to just get seats that were left. Ended up in a window seat which I had tried so hard to avoid. Cabin crew couldn't seem to care less. Not a great experience all round and then 11 hours with that seat again never again.,Detractor

At the end of the day, it's my fault for not doing research beforehand about this airline. My husband and I along with our 8 month old traveled from Chicago to Baltimore to visit family. We decided on Spirit Airline due to its low cost ($200/ticket). We booked this trip far in advance and the downside of purchasing tickets so far in advance is that unexpected things can happen.

Obviously I declined this. Purchasing two new return tickets would only cost me $200 ($100 each way from BWI to ORD). We checked in online, printed the tickets and guess what? We still had to check in with an agent. We waited 30 mins for our departure flight and our return flight just to check in with an agent.

" Madrid to Shanghai, ""old-style"" Business class configuration (2-2-2). Seats are quite comfortable, fully reclinable, but very little privacy (if any). Boarding quite smooth. Entertainment system good but not the latest version, and headphones not noise-cancelling. Despite business class not completely full, they didn't have enough menus for everyone: me and my neighbor had to change choice as they didn't have enough Chinese menus on board, as well, not all wines listed are available. In any case, food was quite tasty. Overall, a good flight with China Eastern Airlines, had a good sleep, and overall impression is positive. There is WIFI on board (albeit, not really fast).",Promoter
IAD-JFK E190 Had an Even More ticket. I seen no evidence of Even More Speed at IAD. Ended up in the normal security line. Seat was spacious. We encountered a 2.5 hour delay due to a dent found on the aircraft. I do believe they should have let passengers disembark. However IFE was switched on and snacks distributed so they managed the situation very well. The complete product in a normal situation I think is great.,Promoter
"We went to Vienna last year with Brussels Airlines to celebrate new years evening in the magnific city of Vienna. Because of the snow and cold weather the engines were frozen and they need to de-froze them. So, we had a delay of +2hrs. Actually, we had to sit down for 2h in the airplane. The staff was not that friendly and there were noisy babies aboard. The flight was not what we expected, because we arrived late in Vienna. The plane comfort was okay.

"People are complaining about WOW airlines because they don't know that its business model is very different. Once you understand that everything has a cost, and the cost is very expensive, then you can fly cheaply as I did. Note that a bottle of water costs 3 euros. I saw a lady buying two bottles of something that is free most everywhere in the world. The only thing that is free is one small carry on that weighs less than 10kg (22 lbs). Such a deal. It went up from 5 kg the first time I flew WOW. Obviously, with all the restrictions, you have to plan ahead. For me, WOW fits my expectation of an airline, that is, inexpensive RT tickets. WOW is notoriously late, so if you book your own connections, plan on a wide connection timing. Otherwise, you will have to rebook your connections at full fare. That will definitely increase your blood pressure. For a solo traveler who is on a budget, this airline is perfect.",Promoter

"  Redmond to Reno via Portland. I've had a lot of good experiences with AlaskaAir, but this trip was not a good one. Two hours before the flight, I get an e-mail saying ""Sorry, your flight has been canceled."" However, the e-mail, ios app, and online all showed the same exact itinerary. It wasn't until I arrived at Portland did everything update to show that my PDX-RNO flight was completely canceled. I was auto-booked for a flight the next day. Not only is that terrible, but the lady at the counter was able to fit me into the last seat on a flight that afternoon, which means the auto-booking system isn't helpful. I had to sit in Portland twiddling my thumbs for 8 hours, and it was awful. Here's the redeeming qualities of Alaska Airlines, the rep gave me some vouchers for food and snacks, and discount codes for my next booking. Not a worthy trade to me, but at least they were apologetic and tried to remedy the situation as best they could. Like I said, this was my only bad experience with Alaska so I won't swear them off for that. Except for the flight attendant that skipped over me for a drink. That was annoying.",Promoter
" Vancouver to New York. I hadn't flown with CX if a few years, so I was looking forward to their amazing hospitality, food, comfortable seats, and great service. Sadly, their food and outdated seats made it uncomfortable. Their meals service for this short-haul flight was worse than flying North-American airlines' business class. I know that this flight is late at night, but the meal was small and taste-less. The cabin crew were more concerned about turning off the cabin lights than to actually serve the customers. The seats on this particular plane were very outdated and needed refreshing. A few spots had the fabric torn-up. CX - I had faith in you. Where did the 5 star go?",Passive
DOH-JED-DOH. Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.,Promoter

"I can say that without a doubt myself nor my girlfriend will ever fly Air China ever again. Checking in at Vancouver they made us aware they forgot our middle names on our initial flights, made us sign a waiver form to state that we may have to pay an additional fee because some countries may not allow us entry because of this fault. Now we had 3 flights with them Vancouver to Beijing, Hong Kong to Beijing and Beijing back to Vancouver. In these 3 flights they served us water 4 times, both our monitors were broken for one whole flight and their response was a collective sort of ""not understanding you, I'll walk away without doing anything"". On one flight my girlfriends headphones were broken, a simple fix you would think, so we buzzed an attendant because they were never doing their job properly - it took over 15 mintues before anyone even bothered to show up, she looked and acted very disgruntled over the fact that someone made her do anything, after telling her that our headset was broken she proceeded to yell ""broken"" to which a few other guests turned around. On the final flight home we were lucky enough to be given water twice during our 12 hour flight and given two meals (a blessing for this airline). We decided to ask for a beer to follow up our dinner, we were told straight out ""no!"" and we asked why to which we were given no answer. I asked for a Ginger Ale or Sprite to which we were told ""no!"" and we said ""Water?"" to which she didn't say a word, disappeared, placed both cups on my stand and walked away to sit down and ignore customers for 3 more hours.

However, a great price came up that included a return Bangkok Airways return flight between Bangkok and Samui - and I was really very impressed. The new 1-2-1 herringbone layout in EVA business is a significant improvement and makes the cabin much calmer and more relaxing. It is the crew, however, for which I must reserve the most fulsome praise. On this flight (and indeed on my return) they were utterly delightful - efficient, friendly, attentive and with lovely personalized service. Check-in at Heathrow was effortless, the Air Canada lounge in terminal 2 was lovely and tranquil (I think that had much to do with the late evening departure of my flight) and boarding was equally as easy. The food on EVA is not as good, in my experience, as that of Emirates or Qatar, but the crew seemed to be endlessly on-hand (not disappearing mid-flight as with some carriers) with drinks and the offer of snacks. I'm not a fan of the daylight return flight from Bangkok but, at the right price, I would use EVA again without hesitation.",Promoter

"  Flew from San Francisco to Boston. I use to love Virgin but now two flights in a row I have sat on the tarmac while they fixed an issue with the plane. Twice now with well over an hour delay in a row for an airline I use to consider reliable. The worst part was the complete lack of information. The employees ran for whatever hidden cover they could to avoid questions. The captain came on just to give a 15min update of we aren't moving yet and they are working on it because in his words, ""he was required to by law"" as if the law wasn't there he wouldn't care. The lack of communication is dumbfounding for an airline who use to pride themselves on customer service and quality. The least they could do is give us a free movie for the delay but they didn't last flight that had a 2 hr delay and I have no faith this one will either if we ever get off the ground that is. Should have stuck with Southwest. They are bare bones but at least they seem to care.",Detractor
LX 288 ZRH-JNB May 6th 2014. Business class. A really good flight in an A330 with the now excellent flat beds and space. The food wine and the service were excellent with a 30 minute early arrival at JNB. The starboard seats are the ones to go for as they are single. The only criticism I have - a Swiss IA responsibility though the service is subcontracted - is that in the business lounge there is free wi-fi but only for 60 consecutive minutes. After that there is a charge. As I had a 5hr wait this was very inconvenient. Surely having pitched up a business class fare they could at least emulate many high street coffee shops and provide unlimited wi-fi without charge. it's not a big charge in the context of the fare more a matter of principle.,Promoter

FR5579 21 July returned 28 July on FR5578. My family and I travelled to Benidorm for 7 days. Our travel with Ryanair was less than perfect. On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet â€œnowâ€. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes.

All my flights were on time and if there was any slight change of even a minute I was notified. Check in was very smooth and likewise with boarding.

"China Eastern Airlines was the worst airline I've flown with. Starting with the wrong information given by the check-in agent at LAX about immigration and customs (you go through those in Nanjing, but she insisted we would not leave the plane there), we were in for a treat. Even though the plane was new (B-5902), if felt very old, with seats getting jammed when trying to move them and lots of noise. Food was horrible, so I would highly suggest getting a sandwich at the airport just in case. Sodas were served warm (and they only have Pepsi). Upon arrival in Chengdu, they offer no assistance whatsoever as to where to go for your luggage, and it's really easy to end up in the domestic terminal since there's no signs and nobody to help. On the way back, check-in opens at 8am for a 9.30am departure. Lines are not respected and people just cut in front of you. There's no separate line for business class, but that wouldn't have mattered much since the ones cutting in line were business class customers. Once you get to Nanjing, expect to have a choice between a local restaurant that doesn't look very good and a place that sells snacks at airport prices. You can actually see the McDonald's and Starbucks on the other side, but can't access them (I'm not a McDonald's fan, but at that point it would've been very welcome instead of China Eastern food).",Detractor

Flew from IAD to JNB and returned 2 weeks later. My very positive impression of the flight to Jo'burg was tempered by two items. First the rather lacklustre service provided by the crew on the return flight and by the (possibly) worst economy seats in the industry. I'm a little over 6 feet so I'm rarely very comfortable in economy seats but these go past just discomfort. I also have an issue with SAA's seat selection process.

Apparently that means little or nothing as those seats weren't available when check-in time arrived. I know seat selections aren't guaranteed but really why bother?,Passive

"  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.",Passive

"  We booked our flights in April and only chose 'Business Class' because I don't fly well and needed a window seat at the front of the plane. Wow's 'Business Class' seats were available, indicating our rows 2 and 3 selections with window seats, and confirmed in April. A week before departure, without notification, I noticed that our seats were changed from the 3rd row window to the 25th row exit, no window - middle and aisle seats - for the long haul arms of the return trip! I called WOW immediately and was told the plane was changed and other people already had our 3rd row seats. But we booked 5 months ago - did everyone from rows 1-11 book before then? I explained I don't fly well and why couldn't someone else be moved 22 rows down the plane, no window, instead of us, who paid almost $1,000 more to be at the front. I asked for another flight. She said ""sorry"" there wasn't one. She said we'd get $47 back for being moved if we applied for a refund. Ridiculous! I emailed WOW that our involuntary downgrade was unacceptable and requested to be moved near the front, but I didn't get a reply to my email until after we returned to Canada. Even at the departure gate the airline rep. told us the flight was overbooked, with no hope of moving us near the front of the plane. The email response was ""We would like to inform you that there is no Economy or Business class with WOW air, it is just the inclusions which make a difference."" Because we were moved to an exit row, with extra legroom, they considered that ""you have been provided with the seats for which you have paid for."" But obviously not the location we paid extra for. They conceded that we didn't get quite the legroom we paid for, and will be issuing a $29.24 credit. The email next said ""Moreover, we would like to inform you that booking WOW Biz does not always include the best available seat, it depends upon the availability."" WOW air lured us into believing the only way to sit near the front of the plane comfortably with legroom, was to purchase their Biz Class seats, for which they clearly indicated on the plane seating diagram for our flight. Then they changed the plane a few days before departure to one with 2 less total seats, even though the flight was overbooked, and moved us 22 rows down, no window, and gave us $29 compensation for that.",Detractor

"Flew YVR-OGG (Maui) return this month with my husband (6') while I am 5'4"". We had seats 42H and 42K. On the outward bound flight the air was blasting so much I was frozen and to make matters worse I was suffering with a pinched nerve in my neck. I was unable to put my head at the correct height on the head rest for any support as I am too short to reach it. I couldn't lean against the window (even though I had my own pillow and a special neck support collar) as there was a gap which my pillow would fall through. The return flight was even worse starting with check in at the airport. If you haven't done web check-in which isn't always possible while on holiday you have to wait in line while those people who have take their baggage to the agents. They had 3 lines one for priority one for web check-in and one for everyone else. There were 4 desk agents dealing with passengers. The flight was a red-eye and I was prepared for the blasting cold air but my husband had to borrow my scarf to cover his face and head because he was freezing. The flight crew tried hard but they are really not very professional. I never used the inflight entertainment option because using and iPhone or iPad was not something I could do with my neck issue. I had no idea when I made my reservation that there was no seat back entertainment. That has always been one of the Air Canada pluses - they have great movies. The only thing I can is the flights were on time both ways but that is no excuse for this poor show. What is Air Canada thinking? I have always flown them by choice and supported them. Their regular airline is great and their overseas business class for Europe is my first choice all things considered. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again.",Detractor
" Hostile ground staff at the gate. Very friendly, very senior cabin crew. Surprisingly (for Qantas) soft black seats showing evidence of previous meals and passenger hairs. With the large threatening words ""tablet use only. Max 1kg"" in your face all the way. Seat pitch tight and toilets like vertical coffins. The only meal choice was vegetable green curry at 10.30am. Or an apple. The other choice appeared to run out about half way down the cabin. Not surprising with green curry that early. One hour before landing given a frozen fruit juice ice block labelled ""made in China"". From an airline that rests on Aussiecentric marketing. At descent, offered a chocolate of a brand known to taste like soap. So nothing appealing to eat in over 4.5 hours. No seat back entertainment. Overhead screens glarey and barely visible, showing some superhero movie. Why is it you can fly Sydney - Melbourne and get unnecessary seat back entertainment often but never on a 4.5 plus hour flight to DRW. The only difference from a low cost carrier was the fast checkin and age of the flight attendants. Arrived hungry and felt ripped off and certainly not relaxed. Not worth the money.",Detractor
" Shanghai to Sydney. A complimentary limo service from Shanghai hotel to PVG which luckily arrived early, as the queues for security at PVG seemed endless. The PVG lounge was well equipped with showers and plenty of quiet zones with charging facilities and a good range of food and beverages. Better and more quiet in the upstairs area though. On board and closed up ready to go on time and arrived in SYD a little early. Seating layout was the older 2-2-2 but OK for a good sleep with the seats flat, although the cabin was kept a little too warm for my sleeping habits. Sleep took priority over IFE so I cannot comment on that. The food options were all tasty, with good, attentive service and plenty of snacks during the flight if needed. Spirit offerings eventually had to be refused as the servings were becoming a little too frequent. Good service levels on the return international flight. This was the first flight allowing phones to be switched on in flight mode following a relaxation of the rules by the government.",Promoter

"Barcelona to San Francisco via Madrid. Transatlantic sector was ok. Again, the food service, which was the main interaction with the crew, was poorly presented and unattractively arranged. I wish US flight crews would travel on foreign carriers from time to time just to see what style means when providing service. The Boeing 77=37-800 domestic leg was delayed and the FA was completely indifferent - rarely speaking and even fewer smiles. If the job is that much of a drudge, why not try something else.

The interior of the aircraft was spotless. However, there was no catering per se other than a to buy Marks and Spencer items. No cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed.

"  My experience with China Eastern Airlines has been by far the worst of any airline I've travelled with. I was travelling three consecutive flights, the first of which (Seoul - Shanghai) was delayed 8 hours. No reason given. They changed my connections, gave me a $10 food coupon and all was well. Or so I thought. The airline then tricked me and the others with connections into signing a waiver, saying we would still make our connections as the flight was on time. Yet the plane was delayed again and everyone with connections missed their flights! I couldn't believe it. They had known the plane wouldn't be on time and we weren't going to make our connections and tricked us into waiving all their responsibility! How dishonest and slimy. Luckily I took a photo of the waiver before signing it, as I was suspicious about it. The staff were acting like dodgy salesmen tricking you into signing a bad contract or something. Turns out I was right. I should mention that they gave us 80000won (maybe $60aud) as compensation for the delayed flight. We spent a tedious 3 hours in customs, as we now had to leave the airport. They were so understaffed I can't believe the Shanghai airport can even function. I was told to go to one place, yelled at, told to go to another place, no one had any idea what was going on and hardly anyone spoke English. Or if they did, they concealed that fact to dodge responsibility for answering my questions. My flights were changed again and now I would be landing 26 hours after I was supposed to. 50 hours in transit, and currently stuck in Shanghai. Exhausted and angry, we waited for an hour and a half in the airport and another staff member shuffled us into a rickety bus and took us to a hotel. The hotel staff were lovely, and dealt with us swiftly and kindly, despite it being 4:00am now. We were fed too, but after heading back to the airport the next day, I asked 3 separate info desks but was provided with no food coupons and had to exchange my own money to buy food. The staff were rude and unhelpful. There is no information given to customers when things go wrong and the airline does their best to rip you off and dodge responsibility for their company's mistakes. The worst part is, there's nothing that can be done. I've signed a waiver that excuses them for any compensation, and there's nothing I can do.",Detractor
"I flew from Frankfurt to Seattle with Lufthansa (LH 490). Boeing 747-400 with a rather old cabin. The seat provided a very decent legroom, so the comfort was sufficient to me. Cabin crew was outstandingly nice, although a stewardess adressed me always in English and the american woman next to me in German, which was quite funny. The food delivered was delicious and drinks were available to all passengers during the entire flight. IFE selection was really poor, but I watched a nice film and therefore, the selection was ok for me. IFE was slow, but as I heard it from a friend of mine working with Lufthansa, they updated it. Flight on time, cabin very clean - overall a nice experience! I highly recommend to fly with Lufthansa on both short and long-haul flights.",Promoter

BUD-IST-KIX (Istanbul-Osaka) and return. Short range A320 and B737-800 were a bit tighter seated but the A332 on IST-KIX and back was very spacious. We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance.

I've been travelling with SA for many years each year a trip from UK to Australia via Singapore some years 2 trips. In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty. (I look respectable honestly!).,Passive
"  Brussels to Entebbe via Istanbul. Our train was delayed, but we arrived at the airport 80 minutes before our scheduled flight. The check-in area was very busy and confusing with several queues. We waited in the queue for 25 minutes to find out that we had been standing in the wrong queue, as there were two flights to Istanbul that day at similar times. We came to the check-in counter when the lady informed us that we are at the wrong counter and we are too late and check-in is already over. She then directed us to the Turkish Airline counter but he told us that he cannot help us. We pointed out that we only have two small carry-on bags and all we need is a boarding pass (and we still had 50 minutes to departure). He refused with a smirk adding that that's not his problem. We ended up spending thousands of Euros for our new tickets, paying for a hotel, and changing the schedule of our trip and all of it was unnecessary. We understand that there are strict airline policies and passengers need to arrive to check-in on time. All we needed was for someone to issue us tickets.",Detractor
"  Munich to Abu Dhabi in First class. I flew Eithad to the US twice before from the UAE in first and raved about the food, service and comfort on its 380. So roll on three years forward and a business class booking where I spent good money to upgrade to first from Munich to Abu Dhabi where the experience could not have been more different and disappointing. The outbound flight EY04 Boeing 777-300 seat was the first shock since clearly these seats had seen a better day and for the most part unless fully extended was uncomfortable. The leather padding kept moving around and thus prone to slide in the sitting position. Unlike the two prior trips where the first class seating was big enough to seat two people these seats were not. The aircraft seemed old and worn unlike the new 777's which are great to fly. The food options were greatly diminished from prior Etihad flights and I was a bit shocked to see just how uninteresting the menu was. I ordered food but then decided to cancel since sleep was needed. I did not feel like I missed anything and other reviewers confirmed it. I would have liked something to munch on even though the plane had less than an hour before landing but the answer was no. Really not even a breakfast roll? I had to keep asking for coffee refills but at least I got that. Very different from my prior Etihad flights where service was outstanding. The movie selection was mediocre and not worth turning on to watch the films available. The other on board surprise was the FC toiletries that were handed out. An oversized bag with tiny samples of lotion or toothpaste. Etihad no longer carries the Bergamonte brand it did previously and clearly my bag was exactly the same as business. Etihad use to be much more generous in its offering both size and quality of products. Once I passed immigration I decided to stop into the arrivals lounge for a bite to eat since I missed my meal and the food offerings there were a joke. Some tiny sandwiches tea, juice or coffee. So I passed and decided to wait until I reach my hotel. Etihad has also cheapened its car service by insisting you buy a full fare ticket before you have access to the service. At first their worthless customer service said no but I tried requesting again online and got a confirmation of service so I was able to use it. The supervisor in the line of cars awaiting Etihad passengers had to argue with four of the drivers before one would agree to take me as I was not that far from the airport. I was shocked to watch them go back and forth. The value if I had booked a car service they recommended for the discounted FC passengers from AUH to the Intercontinental $35. Now Etihad has become so cost cutting that on a $5500 ticket they didn't want to cover the $35 cost or even pay for the $20 taxi ride to my hotel? So average service, mediocre food, worn out first class seating, unnecessary rules for first class car service",Passive
" San Diego to Pittsburgh. By far the worst airline experience I've ever had. We flew in to San Diego for a week with a round way ticket and when we were supposed to be flown home the flight was randomly cancelled and we weren't alerted until two hours before, by which time we had already traveled to the airport to check in. When we went up to check our bag(which cost 75$ to check) and get our boarding passes, they told us the flight was cancelled, not delayed, but cancelled, because of â€œlightening stormsâ€. Ironically, other planes from different airlines were still flying to the same location the same day and time. How funny! We tried to talk to someone at the front desk and they wouldn't give us any help. They told us the only options frontier was providing was rebook or refund. The next flight home to Pittsburgh on frontier wasn't until two days later, they told us. They wouldn't refund our entire round trip flight, only the â€œunused portion of our ticketâ€. They weren't able to help us get another flight on a different airline and they were not willing to help us in the slightest. It was outrageous. They also weren't going to pay for us to stay in San Diego another two days. We went to book the flight for Wednesday, two days later, to get home but, who knew, there was no space! They told us we could fly out Thursday instead. We go to book it and there's not enough space. We are told that our only option is to stay until Friday! An extra four days! Stranded! We had lives to get back to! So what we ended up having to do was by last minute flights on other airlines and it ended up costing us almost an extra four thousand dollars to get home!

I neither would fly Emirates again nor recommend them. They position themselves as a high end service but are actually low cost/low service. We just flew Rome to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok. The Dubai to Sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating (3-4-3). The 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but EK has added an extra seat in the middle. The cabin is like a sardine can.

Business class AMS-ORD-YVR. Check in went very smooth departure with 15 minutes delay due to air traffic control. I was seated in a window seat which was ok but if you want to get out of it you have to bother your neighbor. Flight attendants were quite old no youngsters like on flights with KLM.

We booked a flight from SFO to LAX on United and a separate flight from LAX to Europe. Layover in LAX was supposed to be 5 hours - but rather safe than sorry is what I thought - and sorry we were to be: Upon entering the aircraft doors closed we were informed of a minor delay due to traffic restrictions. A while later a technical problem was added to the mix and they promised to keep us informed. It kept going on like this for a while until about two hours later we were released from the plane and tried to get on the next flight. After a total of three hours the ticketing agent kindly re-booked us on a Delta flight to LAX. We landed just in time to possibly make it on our next plane but the surprise was that our baggage was still on the original plane.

" Flew Delta Comfort+ from Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta. Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers.

I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about.

The newly launched connection FRA-KUL is really worth the extra money. Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs. We were really pleased with the service and comfort of this new connection/product.

" We were on a flight from Nice to Vienna on 21 December 2018. After clearing security, we were informed that the flight was delayed and then the flight was cancelled. We had to be removed from the secure area. Stood in line for an hour, with no information forthcoming. 20 of the passengers were then rerouted through Rome, including my husband and I. In Rome we had 35 minutes to change terminals and get a boarding pass. If we were not relatively fit, we would not have made our flight. We arrived in Vienna at 22h55, instead of at 16h45. Thus a delay of over 6H. Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. Under this regulation passengers are entitled to compensation for these kinds of delays. I contacted the airline, and was denied any compensation as according to the airline the cancellation was due to: ""Unfortunately, according to EU Regulation 261/04, paragraphs 14 & 15, we cannot provide compensation for the flight irregularity that has remained because the reason for cancelling the flight was the weather condition. Meteorological conditions are beyond the control of the airline and exclude the obligations of the airline"" I asked for clear evidence of weather conditions incompatible with the safe operation of our flight, as to my knowledge, the weather at the time was fine, and other airlines were operating flights as normal, taking off from Nice and landing in Vienna, while ours was disrupted. My request for information was denied. Surely, if you could not fly due to the weather this information will be on hand and easy to give to disgruntled passengers. Why refuse to give this information, unless you have something to hide or just do not want to comply with EU rules?",Detractor

When complained and talked to the Supervisor at the Emirates customer service was complete disregard to customers.

" Where do I even begin with this airline? I could start by saying I will never be flying with them again. American has not once, but twice lost my infant car seat, stroller, and base when flying with a 5 month old baby. My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight. So I carried my child to the opposite end of the airport with no stroller and no extra hands to carry my personal items. When I arrived at my next gate and told the new American employee what was going on she responded by saying. ""Oh, you're going to have to go back to the gate you came from. That isn't in my department since you came from a different gate"". So extremely frustrating! I then proceeded to ask the employee how she expected me and my child to get home from the airport with no car seat or base when I arrive at my final destination. She then stated that I can file a claim with American and ""maybe"" they will supply me with a used one to get home from the airport. $250 later my husband had to meet me at the airport, 2 hours from our home with a brand new car seat and base we had to purchase so that we could safely leave the airport with our child. When we arrived at our final destination we were then told our baggage had never even left the first airport we left from. American Airlines stated if they could find our items they would send them to our address. Two days later an American airline employee shows up at our house at 1am with our items! One o clock in the morning! This is one of the most ridiculous and stressful experiences I have dealt with. American not only has terrible customer service but not one of their employees was knowledgeable or accommodating to our situation. This was a nightmare and totally unacceptable! I would advise anyone to steer clear of flying American Airlines. Thank goodness for family that was able to meet me at the airport with new items to get home, otherwise I may have been stuck at the airport with my child all night! So extremely pathetic American Airlines.",Detractor
" Minneapolis to Toronto via Charlotte. Due to an ice storm in Toronto, my connecting flight from Charlotte to Toronto was canceled (which I understood, and I support the airline in wanting to keep passengers safe). I admit that I was frustrated and worried because I was having trouble connecting to the CLT wi-fi to let my family know I was stranded (and I had never been stranded before), but even so, the lack of sympathy from the American Airlines staff was just staggering. The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back."" After an hour or so, my bag finally showed up. When I caught my rescheduled flight 2 days later, the AA staff at O'Hare were just as rude as the ones at CLT! I was not able to check in online for my connection, and only wanted someone to confirm whether I would be flying out that day, as I had a family member in Toronto waiting to pick me up and would have to message that person if I was delayed. When I went up to the desk at my gate, there was no-one there, but a young AA staff member was hovering nearby, so I asked him if he could help me. I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight. Other than the stewardess who grumpily loaned me a pen so I could complete my customs form, there wasn't a single American Airlines staff member I encountered who could be described as helpful, and none of them were kind or pleasant. I was a stranded student who had chosen AA so that I could come home from an academic conference a day early to save $350. Now, all the money I saved by choosing AA is gone because I received no vouchers, no guidance, no sympathy and no help. My first experience with American Airlines, which spanned multiple airports, showed me how rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service people can be. And based on most of the other reviews on this site, I'm not alone in that discovery. I just wish I'd checked reviews before trying to save money - this was a painful and costly lesson to learn the hard way.",Detractor

"  Doha to Paris CDG via Bahrain and London, premium economy is really good. The return flight to CDG via BAH and LHR was $500 more than a direct flight in Qatar economy class.

So landing from Doha I can shower and have breakfast before the short hop to Paris. I think there are plenty of passengers from Qatar willing to pay extra for premium economy rather than shell out for business class originating in Doha.

We used Turkish on 5 segments for a group trip where many members arrived in IST for a 2 week trip. Of the 22 members of the group who arrived from all corners of the world nearly everyone had a story about Turkish failings. Business class on TK46 from IST to KIX was a perfect example. Plane was a beat up 330-200. Boarding was a mess. Loaded onto a bus in IST in the rain. Driven around the tarmac for 15 minutes to our plane. All passengers loaded through the rear of the plane on a mobile jetway in the rain. To get to the business cabin we had to 'swim upstream' to our seats.

"  Vancouver to Bangkok via Hong Kong. At Vancouver check-in the lady who checked me in was cheerful and funny, contrary to my previous experiences while checking in in Vancouver. I was initially supposed to fly in Premium Economy Class for the entire itinerary until I was notified of a seat change on my flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. An upgrade to Business Class was definitely a true blessing on a transpacific flight and I couldn't be more impressed with the service I received. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Vancouver provides such a serenade prior to a long-haul flights, where the staff were so accommodating. The crew were prompt to respond to requests and made me feel welcome and comfortable. The seat didn't feel too different from the regular Premium Economy seat in terms of width, however, when turned into a flat bed, provided one of the best sleeps I've had among other Business Class I have experienced. I appreciated the details put into the seat, adequate storage and the mirror in one of the compartments, and light at one of the storage areas. Despite all the positives, I felt indifferent towards the catering. Though the main courses and drinks were great, there were components of the meals that left me underwhelmed. Arrived Hong Kong on schedule and made my way to The Wing lounge. Staff were enthusiastic to help. Hong Kong to Bangkok in a bulkhead seat in Premium Economy Class. Despite my love towards the bulkhead seat on Cathay's Economy, I was at fault for selecting this bulkhead in Premium Economy. The fact that the personal screen couldn't be used during take-off and landing made for a very boring flight for me, again, not at all the airline's fault. Since it was a regional flight, meal service was similar to that of Economy Class, and it was a standard breakfast meal which satisfied me. Crew service on this short flight left a bit to be desired, but since it was a rather early morning flight, the cabin itself seemed dry. Bags were among the first ones out in Bangkok and I was out of the airport within 30 minutes of arriving. On-time departure and arrival on both flights. Overall, though there were things that could be improved, this has been my best journey so far and I look forward to use their service again very soon.",Promoter
"Just flew R/T from IAD-AMS-Dammam Saudi Aradia. I have not been on KLM international for years and based on European flights I had taken I was not expecting much. They had exceptional fares to Middle East so I tried them out. I was really very pleasantly surprised. Outstanding service on all 4 legs of the journey. Staff very attentive with the purser speaking to every business class passenger. Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to. Amsterdam is a very good transit airport and the KLM lounge is very good thought it does not have a great variety of foods (what it has is good). Best part of the lounge for me was the ""deep rest"" room with chaise lounges in carrells in a very dark room with just enough light to get around.

"  Inter-Europe Business Class is always a disappointment and Lufthansa's A319 is no exception. This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price. As always, though, with Lufthansa, this flight was friendly and efficient with timely service, a decent meal and no surprises.",Passive

They are severely understaffed and use outdated computers and communication systems so everything is super slow for check in. At OKC two of the 3 kiosks weren't working.

"I flew to Phoenix from Toronto on Dec 28th Business Class and returned Jan 5 2015. Both were equally disturbing in their own way. The bottom line is that if Air Canada is going to charge full fare on a flight then it should not be ""charter"" quality. If I pay to fly business then I should get what I pay for. As for economy the leg room is atrocious for a 5 hour flight. If the person in front of you leans back then their seat is a few inches from your nose. Also we were not warned ahead of time that there would be no entertainment- they tell you to download the app to watch movies on an Ipad or Iphone but they provide no charging mechanism for your battery so you are forced to rent an Ipad for $10. If we are paying the same rates as a regular Air Canada flight shouldn't the entertainment be free just like on those flights? Air Canada used to be my go-to airline.

" San Francisco to Dallas. Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home.

When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane.

She just kept saying get in line, where people were checking bags, we had no bags to check in with and by this time it was 5:15 and had to wait in line for over 45 minutes with people that were checking their bags. Running to security, then to gate ( I had hurt my back and have horrible sciatica down my leg) but my son ran a head and got to the gate at 5:55. The attendant told us the doors just closed and we were unable to board plane. So we missed our plane home after a very emotional 2 days, because an employee at the check in wouldn't take the time to look at my phone and explain I could use that for boarding pass and did not need to wait in line for 45 minutes. I will never use this airline again. Also now reading others experience with this airline ( should have known better when calling with questions before even leaving for this trip. The customer service for this airline is just as bad, no matter what button you press for a question. They also have NO discounts for families of Americans veterans, money is all that matter to this airline. Never again will I ever use this airline, no compassion, no help with questions from their customers. Horrible!!",Detractor
"We were unfortunate enough to have travelled on easyJet flight EZY8612 from Malaga to London Gatwick on 27th March which was diverted to Liverpool. After the flight delay, which exceeded 3 hours, on leaving Malaga we were subsequently unable to land at Gatwick because the weather had deteriorated. No reasonable explanation was given for the delay. Regarding the issues with our flight it was almost unbelievable that we were left stranded at Liverpool airport with no arrangements made for our onward travel to Gatwick. Even more outrageous was the fact that the airline was continuing to charge passengers for food and drink on board while we were being held for hours on the tarmac before disembarking at Liverpool. We have never experienced an organisation that appears to reagrd its customers with such contempt. We won't be using easyJet ever again and would advise others not to use them unless they are willing to accept this kind of service.",Detractor
" Barcelona to Rome. Worst company encountered in 30 years of flying. They cancelled my flight, pushed me around for over a month telling me that I was going to get 250 euros compensation, they asked for my bank account info to transfer the money, and after multiple exchange of e mail and phone calls, where they were kept on telling me that it was a matter of days that I would get my compensation. I received and e mail without a signature (probably they think their clients don't even deserve to know who are they dealing with) saying that my case was reviewed and I don't qualify for a refund, even if the flight was cancelled by them without any apparent reason. They didn't have the decency to tell me in the previous phone calls that I was not getting it.",Detractor

NRT-VIE-ARN (Tokyo-Vienna-Stockholm) with an old 777 between Tokyo and Vienna. Seats were not that comfy and looked like something from the 70s. The entertainment was horrible. The screens had the worst picture ever and they had no on demand. You had to wait for the movie to start on a curtain channel. Food wasn't that good either. We tried two different meals and both tasted pretty bad. Service was slow had to wait 15 min to just get some water after I pushed the button 3 times. After 4 hours wait in Vienna we boarded a Fokker to Stockholm. No entertainment and just a small sandwich were served. I will not fly with them again,Detractor

Singapore to Hokkaido via Tokyo and return. A good performance but nowhere near what I would describe as 5-star. Firstly as many others have mentioned here the shell seats on the 787 are a joke - very very uncomfortable with no possibility of getting into a sleep-friendly position. As far as I'm concerned these seats are a deal-breaker. I would not fly with ANA on a medium or long-haul flight if the seats were this design. The food was acceptable without being outstanding. The service was good but not exceptional. The short hops between Tokyo and Sapporo were efficient and smooth.,Passive
"Outward flight Kuwait to London was on a refurbished 747: flight was on time, cabin crew were hard-working, breakfast was a full British, and excellent, in-flight entertainment was AVOD, and with a wide selection of movies and a huge selection of classical tracks. The flight was smooth, and the information from the flight deck kept us up to date on the progress of the flight. The cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of single-malt scotch for me (good job, guys). Transit through Heathrow was hassle-free, and the flight to Edinburgh was on time, this time on an Airbus 319. Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. The return flight was equally good: prompt departure from Edinburgh, easy transfer at Heathrow, and on-time departure to Kuwait. This time, an un-refurbished 747, with the small seat-back screen, so I did not bother using the entertainment system. The evening meal was the dreaded ""chicken or pasta"" (come on, BA, can't we have a change) but edible and tasty, and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive, passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight. Overall, the flight was up to the usual standards I expect from BA: I was safe, comfortable, adequately fed and watered, and all four journeys were on time and hassle-free, with a professional set of cabin crew and clean, tidy and well-maintained aircraft. Well done, BA.",Promoter
"  I traveled Perth to Rome via Abu Dhabi at the beginning of July alone with a one year old baby. I travel to Italy once a year and i usually go with Emirates or Qatar. This time I chose Etihad mainly because of the inflight nanny service. This service wasn't available on my flight and only found out on the day I flew out. The planes were both very uncomfortable, and no comfort kit or baby toys were offered (as Emirates and Qatar do). Although I requested baby food, nothing was provided. During the flight no one of the staff came and asked if I, a mum traveling solo with a young child, needed help. (Last year Qatar flight attendants came several times making sure all was good and gave me baby food, toys and a pouch with baby lotions and nappies). The food for adults was barely edible and there was no meal choice. I think Etihad has to be considered a low cost airline not a 5-star and should definitely cost less, much less as it is so bad. Not worth the money! It cost more than Emirates and Qatar but it's worth zero compared to them. I will never choose Etihad again or recommend it.",Detractor
Luton-Ljubljana and return. Booked flights 3 days before departure at very cheap rates. I read the negative reviews and was a bit nervous but everything turned out fine. You get what you pay for. Yes there is no leg room (I'm 195cm tall) the seats aren't the greatest. We found it strange that the only way to take bags for free was if you took a small backpack so that's what we did. If you follow their rules you'll have a no hassle experience. Outbound flight was on time and return flight landed 10 minutes ahead of schedule. FA's worked hard and responded quickly when other passengers were seeking assistance. Happy to fly again at a low price and if the flight is 2 hours or less.,Passive
"Had a very unpleasant experience with BA this time. They changed our family seats without warning. First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies are lap seat. Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination, we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service. When babies are crying and very restless we didn't get any help from BA staff. When I flew with other airlines, flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby. BA forgot to unload out stroller when we landed.",Detractor

Probably not helped by the very clear cutbacks in the business class items served inflight nowadays compared to 3 years ago. The food was awful and portions tiny, and even amenity type items seem to have suffered major cuts.

VIE-BUD March 2013. As far as I know Austrian isn't a low cost airline however the baggage allowances (23kg and 8kg) and the strictness of shows it should be.

Paphos to Rome. FR 9697. October 31. Business Plus is a waste of money if there is a bus from the terminal to the plane since then one does not receive Priority Boarding. Also there is no Priority Deboarding so if one is in row 16/17 and there are exits front and rear then one is last off the plane and last at Passport Control. To be of value Business Plus passengers should always board first and deplane first. This would mean that the passengers would travel in a separate bus and all the Business Plus seats should be at the front of the plane just as in any other airline.,Detractor
Flew from Washington DC to Helsinki via Reykjavik in business (Saga) class. I'm not a tall person (5 ft 4) so my feet could not touch the floor from the seat. The so-called footrest was a little metal pad right on the floor so it didn't help either. As the seat upholstery was slippery I could not get any traction for the back from that either so that the entire trip was very uncomfortable. But the worst experience was the luggage delay. OK it happens that the bag sometimes does not arrive and you may have to slum it in your flight clothes for a day. But this time the bag was found quickly but it could not be transported 100 km out of Helsinki in more than 3 days! If I had known this I would have taken a taxi or rented or car and had retrieved the bag myself. I pay their top fare and Icelandair does not seem to think that my luggage deserves decent and prompt handling. Will never fly Icelandair again and will not recommend it.,Detractor

The flight of Austrian Airlines for me and my wife from Toronto (Canada) to Bucharest (Romania), via Vienna, (Austria) was not what I had expected in terms of scheduling and mechanical problems, that led to a half-day delay and missing our my arranged pick-up from the airport to our hotel. However, the ground staff at Vienna was extremely helpful and courteous. We were offered a small lunch voucher to compensate for the delay. When I complained to Austrian Airlines after our trip to Eastern Europe, the customer service staff responded promptly. We were compensated for an amount of Canadian $100, which was much more than what I claimed for our loss. We appreciate the generosity of Austrian Airlines and the customer respect we received from this Airline. It appears that delay in flights is not unusual with Austrian Airlines. This may be an area that needs some improvement. However, the ground staff and on-board services were excellent and the food and drinks are good. The seats and on-board entertainment may need some attention. In summary, Austrian Airlines is a reasonable air travel carrier with excellent customer and on-board services.",Promoter
"Will avoid this airline. Beware of ridiculous checked baggage fees. We tried paying lesser fees online when we were checking in, but the AirAsia website conveniently skipped our baggage options no matter which option we tried to select.

When I told the clerk that I couldn't pay online, because I was told that this was my problem and I should have called the customer service. Don't pay for ""hot seats"" - that's another rip off. You get no extra legroom, but you do get extra 15 minutes in a stuffy cabin waiting for everyone else to board, because ""hot seats"" board first. If you want any food - prepay when you are checking in. Otherwise, you won't even get a glass of water out of them. Value for money - not so good.

"  San Francisco to Perth via Auckland. My wife and I have traveled extensively in first and business class and decided to fly to the USA from Perth via Auckland with Air New Zealand. Normally we would travel through Singapore, but since we had not been to NZ before, we decided to route via Auckland. The herring bone seating arrangement made it very difficult to look out the window and so you spend a lot of time looking inward at fellow passengers, who are looking at you. However, once the bed was down and you were sleeping, this was no longer a problem. But, this is when another disadvantage of this close racked seating became more apparent, the unpleasant smells vented by nearby passengers had you reaching for the air ventilation nozzle, unfortunately this does not exist on the 787. The food was probably down with the worst we have experienced, but the cabin staff did their best to offset this by plying passengers with booze, it seemed their mantra was a drunk passenger was a happy passenger.

"  I recently had multiple horrible experiences with Aeromexico. This first issue I ran into was prior to my flight on October 27 from Tijuana to Mexico City. This was the first flight on my way to Peru for my Honeymoon. The night before the flight I was informed that my first name had been miss spelled by the travel agent who had assisted with booking my flights. I was informed by Aeromexico customer service that it was at the check in representatives discretion whether or not I would be able to fly on each of my flights with a misspelled name. They were not willing to change my name to my correct name and the flight would be non-refundable so if the Airline attendant refused to allow me to fly I would not be able to go on my Honeymoon nor would they be willing to refund my flights. Luckily my connecting flight was with Avianca not Aeromexico and Avianca was able to fix my name on each of their flights. I ended up going back and forth with 14 different customer services representatives with Aeromexico for about 4 Â½ hours the night before my trip. Each customer services representative was excuses orientated rather than solution orientated and gave me one excuses after another about why they could not do something as simple as correcting my name. I continued to hang up on each representative after multiple excuses and would call back in. One representative tried to ask for $150.00 fee for each flight to fix my name so it was spelt correctly, this is when I knew that Aeromexico is all about making the travel experience as frustrating as possible for its customers so that it can get more money out of them. I refused to pay the fees and continued to call back in, I was finally able to speak with someone who somehow fixed my name on my flight home and informed me I would need to take my chances on the way there so I went to the Tijuana airport, did my best to distract the Airline attendant, and was able to get through without them catching my first name was miss-spelt as Jospeh rather than the correct spelling Joseph. This entire experience was extremely frustrating, stressful, and not the way you want to start off your Honeymoon. After an entire night of no sleep, a ton of stress, my wife crying due to the concern of potential not going on a trip we spent over $6,000 on we finally were on our way to South America.

This final flight was meant to be an easy 3 hour 20 minute flight. We ended up flying to Tijuana and when we got to the Tijuana Airport we were informed the fog was too thick to land and we ended up circling around the Tijuana Airport for nearly two hours. After circling for nearly two hours we were informed that the Plane would need to refuel at a nearby airport so they flew us into some random airport somewhere in Mexico where we sat on the runway for another two hours.

" Flew roundtrip Chattanooga to Portland, ME I have not flown for several years, so prepared for challenges. Well, kudos to TSA recheck. Made security one big breeze. The plane in both directions were very small and had no overheads to accommodate the regulation size carryons which was included in my fare. Flying Economy Plus? Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay $25. When got to gate the same agent gave everyone in boarding area baggage tags to check them for free on the jetway! Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane? Overall, flying pinched inside a tiny seat with little leg room was awful. the plane was 57 degrees on return flight and stewardess said they were working on - did finally begin to warm after 2 hours, just before landing. Did not partake of the free drinks and pretzels, so can't speak to snacks, seem crazy in short legs of flight. Would not look forward to flying again and booking online. Too many options you can pick from that just keep adding up and seem annoyingly presented on entire page to get you to spend more. Used to fly a lot, and will not miss it if never go again.",Passive
"My husband and I just flew Cathay Pacific economy return to Europe via Hong Kong for our honeymoon. It was important for me to leave a review as I read so many bad ones for quite a few airlines while I was doing my research. I've now come to realise that most people who leave reviews are doing so because of a problem, so it doesn't indicate the overall satisfaction. With our four flights with Cathay from Brisbane to Paris via Hong Kong, the only issue we encountered was a one hour, twenty minute delay out of Amsterdam which was not at all the airlines fault anyway. The leg room was great (we are 5'9 and 6'3 so this is important), the food was fantastic, service was mostly good (with the exception of one or two sour hostesses), inflight entertainment was excellent and price was great. We will happily fly Cathay Pacific again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.",Promoter
" Casablanca to Washington. I had a plane change in Casablanca, Morocco. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours. The airlines said there was a baggage handler strike so it took awhile to take care of the luggage. We flew to our final destination which was Dulles International. After waiting over a half hour for luggage to come on to the carousal several other passengers including myself went to the luggage counter. We learned they did not load the luggage on the flight. They gave us a form to fill out and it had a claim number spot. I asked for a claim number and he said to just call the number on the form. The next morning I called several numbers and received no help. They said I should have a claim number. I have spent numerous hours trying to get this problem fixed. I am going to travel back to Dulles which will cost me time and money.",Detractor
"  Second time (and last time) flying Jetblue Airways from Port au Prince to Pittsburgh via Ft Lauderdale. Booked this flight because I had a $50 credit from my first disaster with this airline. I really hesitated booking this flight but thought I would give them a second chance. They proved to be the same disastrous mess they were the first time. Sitting in Ft Lauderdale airport, 3 hours delayed, on the floor because there are Jetblue delayed customers everywhere. Over 90% of all outgoing and incoming Jetblue flights on the screen are delayed! (The weather here is perfect, not the cause of the problem). Let me add, all shops and restaurants in this terminal close at 9pm! We are stuck here till 11.:30 (unless Jet Blue changes that for the 6th time today) and not even one offer of food or snacks from Jet Blue. This was not worth the $50 I saved!

JFK-WAW-JFK. The food: In my experience if you book online and request a special meal on your ticket you're good to go right? Wrong! With LOT apparently you have to call ahead and make sure they got your message. I failed to do that so on the flight from JFK to WAW I ended up eating only rice. The meat sauce was abysmal. Same situation going back to JFK: nondescript grey meat sauce with noodles as first meal a salmon sandwich as the second meal (again no choice). Overall very disappointing and frustrating. But what really made me wish I had never set foot on that aircraft again was the unspeakable rudeness of the flight attendants. They addressed the passengers in an abrupt way that could only be construed as terribly disrespectful. Between themselves they talked very loudly. We arrived an hour earlier in JFK and since our gate wasn't ready yet we had to wait an hour for the airport to clear us. These things happen all the time when you fly frequently but the flight attendants were so vocally unhappy about it you would think this is the first time they had to go through that terrible ordeal!,Detractor
"Air India ruined the end of our holiday, flying from Colombo to Paris via Delhi. Flight from Colombo was not at 8:20 am but 12:20pm, so we arrived late at Delhi and missed the flight. About 20 people were already arguing with the staff at the transfer and after 4 hours they said that they will try to put us on a flight from another airline. Between this time no excuses, they were asking us to wait till midnight (about 12 hrs waiting for maybe nothing) - at the transfer finally after this time they propose us a room because they were impossible to give us a flight. After an awful night, we had a boarding pass at 12.40 pm but 1 hour late again! I asked them the official delad paper, they promised this, but I had to run after it. I also asked them to check if my luggage was in the plane because I know that they are incompetent. Now, after 25 hours later, one day of work missed, my luggage is still in Delhi after they promise me that it is the plane. We lose so much energy and when you see other people who had the same problems as us, you don't understand how Air India can be in Star Alliance - they don't deserve it.

Alitalia honored the seats I selected during booking and luggage arrived with no problems. The new cabin was impressive, in flight entertainment was just ok. The only complaints I had was the leg room, compared to other international carriers Alitalia had very little leg room. Also, I did not enjoy any of the meals. I was full with just one bite. Besides the leg room, and meal complaints everything else went smoothly, and would fly Alitalia again on my next trip to Europe.",Passive

"  Flew from Glasgow to Budapest with Wizz Air. Flight was good, no complaints over cabin crew. Food and drink selection available was also good, if expensive, but that's to be expected. The team on the ground however seemed useless and very unorganised. At the Glasgow end, check in opened late, meaning a massive queue and minimum time to get through security and to the gate. Coming home from the Budapest end the organisation was non-existent. There were about 8 Wizz Air flights all due to leave within a relatively short time. Instead of forming queues for each separate desk, one queue was to be formed for all of them - a total shambles. This led to a bottle neck of people trying to even get into the queue, not a safe situation at all! They were the only company offering a direct flight from Glasgow on the days we needed, and were therefore our choice. For a budget airline the price we paid was way OTT. Between the 2 of us it was almost Â£600 for our flights and 1 case between us. I'm aware this was due to Sziget festival being on, but very steep. I would fly again, but only if I had to due to bad experiences on the ground.",Passive

Our 2nd flight was Toronto to Athens, a 9 hour fight. Seating is what it is in this day an time, but most airlines have small TV's in front of you to see a movie or to see the flight. We did not know that we had to download an app on our phones to see a movie and when we did, the movies were so old, we did not bother with them. As meals go, we had a small meal which was chicken, a cold piece of bread, some kind of salad and a small cake. As I said this is a 9 hour flight, so we get breakfast if you want to call it that. All we got was a piece of sweet bread and coffee. The staff were friendly and helpful nothing bad there.",Detractor
LHR to YVR. September 29 2014. I've been a loyal BA passenger for years but after three recent flights that's not going to be the case any more. How BA have the audacity to screen 'BA A Very British Airline' on their IFE is beyond me! While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. The food on BA85 LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. The service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. BA used to have a good IFE selection. Not anymore! Very unimaginative selection of films TV and audio programs. I've recently travelled on Qantas and Air Canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to BA. Air Canada has significantly improved it's standards.,Detractor

There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class.

In Newark they share the Virgin lounge and the Virgin staff treated us very badly, not allowing us food, and denying any waitress service for drink.

Flight attendant just reminded me while I'll never book with Frontier again.

Flew from Sapporo to Haneda on a packed 777-300. Flight departed on time and arrived on time. Boarding was orderly but they allow too many carry on bags onboard the crew had a difficult time closing the overhead bins. As you can imagine 10 across seating is really cramped. Flight was about 1 hour 45 mins with no inflight entertainment except headsets for listening to music and scattered video monitors showing a Japanese documentary. Service wise was bad and minimal. Onboard for an hour and 45 min flight you are only offered water oolong tea and apple juice. No other drinks available not even orange juice. Asked the FA for ice and she just pointed to her drinks. For the price we paid as it was not cheap its definitely not worth it. For Japanese standard of service its appalling.,Detractor
"We flew Thai Airways from London to Bangkok on the morning flight arriving at Bangkok early the next morning. Flight departed more or less on time. Cabin crew excellent, smiling and attentive without being intrusive. It appears that the airline has gone downhill vastly since the last time I flew with them. The menu choices were unremarkable and the standard of catering was totally inadequate - the hot meal was actually served cold. Previously the standard of catering was above average with delicious tasting dishes but there is a major cut back in the food presented. I would go as far as saying it was dire. Entertainment the same films on offer in November as October. Not very interesting selection of films to be honest although I had no problems using the handset to choose what I wanted to watch. I enjoy the camera view of take off and landing. The seat was a lie flat bed although it was a tad on the tight size especially at the feet. The seat configuration in business class on the upper deck is 1-2-1, the middle rows can be either cosy or quite far apart. The massage facility did not work in my seat. Would I use Thai Airways again? Probably not. I would not rate it as a 4-star airline now. It is the staff that make this airline such a success and I cannot praise them enough.",Passive

"Check in both ways was excellent and priority security. British Airways lounge at Heathrow and Spa very nice as was breakfast served there.

Interior much better on the way back. Crew excellent and attentive on way out. Food well presented but poor outbound, better coming back, wine same both ways and rather average. Surprised the hand baggage allowance is same in all classes now, In First class you have an entire overhead to yourself and seat storage, so why not allow First passengers to make use of it?. Priority baggage labelling as always pointless - came out in the middle of everyone elses. The simple question to ask is was it worth it - if I had paid for it, a no.

"  Hong Kong to San Francisco with Cathay Pacific. Work trip, so had to take the seat offered me. I took the window seat in the emergency row bulkhead behind the wing. 777-300 is a big enough plane that overall the cabin felt roomy and even elegant. Suspecting that I would be experiencing a tedious 14 hour flight, I didn't have high hopes, but the seat width was adequate, and nobody was seated next to me. I could stretch out. Cabin crew was courteous and attentive, but they didn't really seem to make much eye contact. Don't remember too many in flight announcements. Cabin overall quiet and comfortable. Plenty of good movies and games. Lots of newspapers. The only negatives I could observe were the bathrooms and the very very cold air coming out of the emergency slide door. I don't know where it comes from, but it was a constant draft once we got to cruise and I had to place my backpack there to prevent getting frostbite.

LHR-HKG (B777) then HKG-PER (A330) and return. Business class. (No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort. I was most impressed and will use them again. The seat does it for me - it is what makes a difference after the flight.,Promoter

Singapore Airlines in its heydays was the service and efficiency pacesetter amongst international airlines. Unfortunately it has lost much of its shine and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive truly international airlines which are more in tune with today's international travellers. Case in point: during my last 2 trips from Melbourne to Singapore and back on First and Business Class 1) Cabin crews lack communication and English language skills most are not able to carry a decent mature conversation. 2) Male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like pre-programmed robots without genuine warmth. 3) Filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing tired airline. 4) Second rate food even in First with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as Soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food.

Even when I explained that it contained valuable items and medication, she still persisted. Boarding was efficiently managed, a pleasant change from the free for all I experienced on my last BA flight. The cabin crew made no attempt to greet passengers, or help with stowing luggage. The snack included in the ticket price consisted of a ""muesli"" which resembled yoghurt with a few oats stirred in, a stale, a unbuttered bread roll containing a slice of plastic cheese and a very small plastic cup of tea.

"I was among the several hundred passengers whose British Airways flight was canceled last night from Dallas Ft Worth to London. No status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. They were not updated. People were told to call 1-800-AIRWAYS for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. One woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. Only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. One couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. They were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. The couple will now miss half their cruise. No screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. There were two other flights out to LHR that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, I missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. I was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. People were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. The customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. No attempt to ""take a number"" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. Not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. The way British Airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! Things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. I am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. I will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to India, and my traveling companion (coming from Atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female. This airline has cost me time, money, and most importantly safety, for myself and my friend.",Detractor
"On a short business trip I was delayed about 4 times by the airline with multiple changes of gate and very minimal notification they were doing this to the passengers. Everyone was very upset and complaining however the airline offered no more than an apology and hope that we would continue to fly with them in the future. Now on my way home all passengers were all deboarded from the plane due to mechanical plane concerns they had before takeoff. Although I agree with ""better safe than sorry"" this airline should have been pertinent and professional enough to have dealt with this problem prior to boarding. As we all wait to retrieve our original tickets from the one spirit employee calling out 300 names with no microphone people like myself are at the risk of missing connecting flights. Shame on Spirit for even considering themselves a decent airline. Time is precious. Time = Money and as cheap as their tickets are it would have been way worth my money to go with any other airline.

"  I flew with Avianca London to Havana return via Bogota this November. Not a nice experience. I never call assistance on a flight but on the first journey, I wanted to ask for a pen to fill in the form they gave us so I rang the bell - but no attendant came, they just ignored the bell. My suitcase arrived with one wheel missing in Havana and I was told to fill a form in at the desk.

After 20mins, she was still not there, I asked another airport person and she called her, then said she was on her way. But after another 10mins, the Avianca lady still wasn't there and no one could tell me where she had gone or when she would turn up at her desk. By then I gave up. On my way back yesterday, I told the Avianca manager at the check-in desk and she filled the form in for me. I did not appreciate that the manager assured me the Avianca desk was always attended and was basically insinuating that I was lying, unbelievable. Other than that, all 4 flights that I took were packed, not a single seat free and the journeys were uncomfortable. On the last Bogota to London leg, they had overbooked and some people could not get on the plane, someone told me 11 of them (they asked for volunteers to stay overnight in Bogota but did not seem to attract any takers!). That plane (Boeing 787) was very uncomfortable, seats were tiny and the heat was so unbearable I could not sleep. The only positive thing about this airline is the cheap cost compared to others companies. At the end of the day, the saying is true, you get what you pay for.",Detractor
Surprisingly enough online check in was not available. Flight schedule was not available online either. A330 middle cabin air conditioning didn't work. There were no air outlet over the seats. TV screen was in the middle section of the plane and people had a hard time watching if sitting by the windows. Electrical outlets behind the seats were not powered to charge the electronics equipment. The entertainment was a joke. The same low grade movies were played both ways. No music to listen to. If not because of passengers brought their own entertainment they would be bored to tears.,Detractor
" Hong Kong to Brussels. Used to fly CX a lot when we lived in HK and was looking forward to flying their business class again. What a disappointment! Seats don't seem as spacious and luxurious as before. The breakfast was tiny. All I got in the continental breakfast was a mini pastry, natural yogurt with a tiny bit of granola and fruit. There was butter but no bread to spread it on! No coffee refill. What happened to the lovely service where food was brought out on elegant carts with bread baskets offered several times? The toilets were also not business standard, more like a good economy. Flew Singapore Airlines out and their premium eco toilets were better than Cathay business. Very sad to see such a supreme airline lower their standard like that. Also the lounge at the airport was so overfilled the exclusive touch is completely lost. Poor food selection. Nice shower facility, though.",Passive
  Frankfurt to Montreal. Skipped the check-in as I was connecting from Johannesburg and headed straight to the Maple Leaf Lounge. The lounge was great with a wide array of breakfast foods and beverages. The shower facilities were also very good. The flight boarded in an orderly fashion and on board the hard product was terrific offering a very comfortable environment. The FA's were friendly but cordial. The food and beverages were of high quality and there was plenty of choice. The IFE had a good selection of movies and TV programs but the music selection seemed rather abstract. Toilets were kept spotless throughout the journey. The flight departed and landed on time. It was an all-round great experience.,Promoter
" Paris to Tokyo via Beijing. The price was great and I wanted to give the airline a chance and fly with them for the 1st time. Tickets not booked on their website: not able to choose seats or special meals. I contacted the airline per e-mail and I could order one special meal. I checked in the day before departure to be sure we sit together. Seating was 3-3-3 on the B777 if I'm right: better than the 3-4-3 on some airlines. Check-in opened around 3 hours before departure: the economy class line was very long. I'm Star Alliance Gold member and I could use the business class: pretty fast and checkin staff in Paris very friendly. But the seats I had checked in for the day before were not available anymore and I ended up on a middle seat. Boarding began 30 minutes later but we arrived on time at Beijing airport.

HKG-SFO July 28 2014 Economy Plus. Quite simply the worst over-pacific flight I've had (I've had about 70+). The United International Economy Plus product is quite simply one of the worst available when aboard a crusty old 747. The IFE was antiquated and the movies were b-movies at best. The plane is old and crusty and desperately in need of an update. Flight attendants were indifferent and nearly tossed meal trays onto your fold down tray. Seats were dilapidated. Flight took off and landed late. This United international product is sub-standard and should be an embarrassment to United Airlines. With Star Alliance partners ANA and Asiana both offering superior product at same price why would anyone fly United? Quite simply the other airlines do a better job on these routes.,Detractor

CX918 B77W MNL-HKG. I am not a regular user of CX but past recent experiences in their new Business Class have been good. The seat is excellent and the catering satisfactory. On this flight I was told that I was being upgraded to First Class but was then advised that there would be no First Class service just the seat and that the catering would be Business Class standard. Having selected a Business Class window seat as always in the CX type of lay-out I was allocated seat 1D in First Class. This is a single centre seat in CX's apparently new First Class lay-out and can only be described as a cell. Its certainly spacious as you would expect in First Class nowadays but there is a feeling of being locked in to a high sided enclosure. The seat itself is like a bench its width would adequately seat two people and has no shape to it. Also there are no overhead bins only a small cupboard that forms part of the cell which is only large enough to take a small bag and a jacket. Roller bags have to be placed on the floor protruding out from underneath the foot-stool that forms part of the flat bed. It was sufficiently depressing that I asked for my Business Class seat back but the flight was full hence the â€œupgradeâ€ and my seat had been allocated to someone else. The Business Class catering dinner on this flight â€“ comprised an adequate fruit salad a main course where a choice of two meat in a sauce and rice and fish in a sauce and rice were offered up on a tray by the cabin attendant. They looked so unappetizing that I passed on the main course. Dessert was a dry looking piece of cake which I passed on as well. This was low standard Business Class catering at its worst there was no menu given so the actual content of the meal was down to guess-work. Finally we were told whilst in the Lounge that there were problems with the IFE on board. We then departed almost 2 hours late. Overall very disappointing and in comparable with other carriers in the Region.,Detractor
" Toronto to Ft Lauderdale. Air Canada used to be great, with delightful service, great in-flight entertainment, legroom, and comfortable seats. When they realized that they have the monopoly and can charge whatever they want, they took the oldest planes from the main fleet, got rid of their IFEs, cut down on crew members, packed more seats onto the plane, and charged the same price as they used to with Air Canada rouge. They can't lose customers because a lot of people have no where else to go! I checked in early for my flight, on the app, but I received row 32, the last row on the plane. IFE weren't supposed to be an issue for me because they replaced it with mobile entertainment. Air Canada gave me an alert saying the service is unavailable on my fully capable product, running the correct version of iOS and the app. Ok, we don't have IFE, let's buy wifi. Right? Nope. 8.95 CAD/hour. I'm very disappointed with the services provided on Air Canada rouge.",Detractor

" I got scared reading negative reviews and want to offer a different experience. We flew on a XXL (BIZ-Class) ticket from Baltimore to Frankfurt and back and had a very pleasant experience. WoW Air operates one of the newest aircraft fleets and all four planes we flew with were 2016 or 2017 build. Our ticket included priority boarding, seat selection, free luggage, free meal and drink. Nothing to complain about. Staff on the plane was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Now, here seems to be the trick: We did a little research and talked to folks who had flown WoW Air before and got some insights. Make sure you adhere to their luggage requirements. Understand that an XXL seat is a seat of the exact same size as any other seat, but it's in the exit row and gives you the additional leg room. There was mention, however in the magazine that the airline has started to add ""real"" Business Class seats to their Airbus 300 planes and plans the same upgrades, with confirmed seating option, to their 321/320 fleet. Know that you do not have in-board entertainment unless you bring your own I-Pad or pay 25$ to rent one. Understand that everything, from water to food, will cost you money. So the bottomline: If you pay only $126 on-way to Frankfurt and expect a 5-star service, you'd be thoroughly disappointed and write a review like the ones we read. If you pay about $400, you get the premium treatment and write a review like this. One thing I can't comment on, is how their service develops once something goes wrong, like many reviewers experienced. We may just have been lucky that everything went well.",Promoter
"  New York JFK to Dublin. This was the worst international flight I have ever experienced. The aircraft was not set up for international as there was no entertainment system. The flight attendants were rude and the food was absolutely awful. At the meal service we were offered chicken or pasta, no explanation, no description. The pasta had a terrible white sauce and mushrooms (who knew). The chicken was adequate. No other services during the flight were offered. I will never fly American internationally again.",Detractor
" My fiance and I arrived at our departure station on time for our vacation in Vegas to get married. The airline boarded and closed the doors early, so when we went to check in at 6:50 (7pm departure time), the staff said that we could not be let onto the plane. We asked the staff for a supervisor to see if there was any way for us to be let onto the plane. We had no carry-ons and we pleaded with the supervisor to see if he would at least ask if we could be boarded. He took the walkie and huffed under his breath before making the call out of sight. He came back less than 2 minutes later and said there was no way. I am so incredibly disappointed and extremely bothered by the lack of customer service and lack of professionalism. Our wedding will now be delayed, we lost our rental car, and we were given a less than desirable flight option at an airport even further away. The cheap tickets are not worth the apathetic and unprofessional staff.",Detractor
"Chicago to Manchester with American Airlines. Worst flight ever. Route was and is advertised with personal entertainment system choice of movies etc. Plane advertised as 787. Instead what we got was a 30 year old 767 that still had its original interior. 6 screens on the centre ceiling that you needed binoculars to see. The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?"" Will never fly this airline again, which is a shame as it was the first time with AA and we were so looking forward to it.",Detractor
"  Singapore to Doha via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. It was nice experiencing Etihad's 787-9. The Business Class layout was much better than other airlines as it gave more privacy, also the IFE offered on this aircraft is much better than the rest of their fleet. The seats are wider but very firm and I could only sleep laying sideways. The cabin service is nice but cannot be compared to Cathay or Singapore or even Garuda and Etihad needs to work on this. The food choice was wide and since I was in the Far East for over a month I choose the Gnnochi to change my palate, but it was an awful choice and I could not even have two mouthfuls. I am not going to blame Etihad for this, as there were safer choices of noodles or biryani but I decided to be adventurous! The flight was short as we had a strong tailwind. Our connection flight was on time and the cabin crew were much better. All our luggage came through safely and I would be happy to fly on Etihad again.",Promoter

While the flights we've had over the years have been good in terms of food price in-flight service and entertainment etc today was quite the opposite. My wife and kids flew to Istanbul from Macedonia intending to get on a flight to Chicago. Instead they were told at the gate that the boarding passes they had received for the flight were not adequate and there were no seats for them. They were turned away and sent to a ""help desk"" that was a nightmare. It took hours to rebook them on tomorrow's flight and they were denied hotel accommodation even though it was the airline's fault. Next time we'll book with a proper European carrier likely spending a little more but saving ourselves the headache and worry.",Detractor
While the service is similar to a regular Business Class flight on Air Canada the seating is in no way business or premium.

"  First time flying this route from Houston to Honolulu and I was not looking forward to it. Why? 8 hours in the sky with no free hot meals (you have to purchase from a menu and it's not cheap - $10 for a burger), no in-flight entertainment screens, and a sardine can economy cabin with the 3-4-3 seating arrangement. All this in mind and I was not eager to fly. As I boarded the plane and settled in my seat I noticed that yes the seats got narrower to accommodate more seats across but the seats are also new and well crafted with details. The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi. (Make sure you have downloaded the United app before you board). The wifi connectivity was fairly strong though it didn't work the last half of the flight. Cabin crew were pleasant. They had poise, well groomed and very polite and I have no complaints or problems with them. The only huge disappointment I have is that for an 8-hour flight, no free meals were offered! It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10. If it was that expensive then it should taste good I thought - which did. $10 Mediterranean chicken wrap was a rather small portion for a $10 meal but the tastes were worthy enough for you to think it came from Chipotle or something.",Passive
"  Bangkok to London via Beijing. I've never written a review before but I'm so appalled by Air China's service that I need to warn others. My flight from Bangkok to Beijing was delayed due to snow in Beijing which meant that I missed my connecting flight from China to London. I wasn't mad at this as bad weather conditions can't be helped but the staff at Air China were unhelpful beyond belief, weren't accommodating or understanding at all and didn't even have the customer service to even apologise for the inconvenience! 10 stranded Brits were appalled by the way Air China handed the inconvenience and that all Air China did was put us on the same flight the next day and barked at us that they would arrange a hotel for us. To make things worse not only could Air China then not retrieve our luggage which we asked for after we waited for it for over 2 hours telling us rudely to just ""wait more"". It took them a total of 4 hours from when we landed, to take and just leave us at a hotel without even translating what had happened to the hotel staff. We all then were left to argue against the hotel staff about an agreement that they had in place with Air China which was that it was two people to a double room regardless of who, and if we wanted a single room to ourselves we had to pay, which meant that we had to stay in a room with complete strangers! Absolutely ridiculous and unsafe! The hotel staff were equally not accommodating or understanding, we were provided with food but were only allowed one bottle of water per person for the night. The next day, we asked Air China if anything could be done for the massive inconvenience and just got a rude ""no"". I'm disgusted at the way Air China operate and their rude staff and couldn't believe that they treated us like the inconvenience was our fault. It was so stressful and looking back to the events, it's unbelievable how we've been treated. When I asked to speak to the manager about how long we had to wait for our transport to our hotel, he just barked at me in limited English telling me to just ""wait, it will be soon"". It's disgusting customer service and attitude, I urge people to not use them as it is not worth saving a bit of money to be treated in this way and ruining your holiday.",Detractor

"  Heathrow Terminal 3 to Budapest in April 2017. Busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers. Seated in row 12F which was the 6th row of economy class. After taking off on-time, it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows. Service was an absolute shambles! 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class. Instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows, one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the iPad payment machine. Instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served, the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served (because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows). The senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left!

"  Phuket to New York JFK via Beijing with Air China. This airline literally ruined the end of my vacation. First of all, the crew from the ticket counter to the airline stewardesses were rude. During the 13 hour flight, the food was disgusting and I was provided the equivalent of 2 dixie cups of water. When I asked for 2 more cups of water, I was told I was only allowed 1! When I asked the second time, I was told to go into the galley and get it myself. I have never been treated with such disrespect. On the way there, in my weariness from traveling 32 hours, I left my tablet in the seat pocket. When I called the airline once I got to the hotel and realized it was missing, I was told that it was not their responsibility and that I would have to deal with the Phuket airport. I called them and of course no one spoke english. Upon returning to the airport at the end of my trip, there was zero Air China customer service attendants to be found and their office was empty. To add insult to injury, while in Bejing on my 1 hour layover, the ticket attendant literally yelled at me and fellow passengers that we were 'slow' and needed to 'hurry up' to make our next flight to JFK - our plane had just arrived! Once getting to JFK, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I had to go to the Lufthansa counter to report my lost luggage becausee (surprise!) no Air China employees could be located. I was told that nothing was in the system tracking my bag and now, 4 days later, my bag is still no where to be found. I can't even file a missing bag claim with Air China because there is no customer service number and in order to file, you must mail or fax (what is this, 1980?) to a number that is provided by the local lost and found office which is unobtainable because no one answers the phone at JFK lost and found and no one returns calls. Long story short, saving money is not worth it. The $200 I had saved has now cost me over $2500 in lost valuables with no remediation.",Detractor
"  Managua to Panama City. For what you pay, Copa is a total rip-off. The flight was on time and I had no problems with getting my baggage, but the experience of flying with them is akin to flying with a budget airline. The cabin interior is worn and tired. The staff are bored and not interested and the food is abominable. It is obvious that Copa is cutting corners wherever they can and they don't care because they know their customers have no choice. Their flights are extremely expensive for the region and they can get away with it because they have a monopoly on a number of routes. Examples are Panama-Managua and Panama-Lima. It is ridiculous that Copa is the only airline that flies between Panama and Lima, Peru but they can do this because the airport claims there is not enough space for other airlines to compete. Copa has stalled the expansion of the airport so that other airlines cannot compete on these routes, but hopefully this will no longer be the case from 2018. I cannot wait to be able to fly with other airlines and ditch this overpriced, sub-standard airline.",Detractor

"  Copenhagen to Taipei via Beijing. I flew with Air China in July and I have never tried a big international airline this disappointing. Economy class did not have individual screens for entertainment. Instead they had a few big screens for all in economy class. Fair enough. However, the screens only showed commercials and no movies, tv series or other kinds of entertainment. They had a few music options (mainly Chinese, fair enough the airline is Chinese), three channels was playing English music, but roughly around 15 songs. That is not a lot of entertainment for 2x7 hours. The staff was a bit rude and as an economy passenger you are pretty much worth nothing or so it seemed. The food was alright.

I flew from Dalaman to Istanbul and on the same day from Istanbul to Lefkosa (Northern Cyprus) in October 2014. Both flights were delayed by 15 mins on take off but made up the time in the air. The seats were slightly on the smaller side and slightly less leg room than other major airlines but I am not too tall and the flights were short so it wasn't a problem. There are drop down TV screens which showed live flight path speed altitude etc. The Pegasus planes were more modern than the Jet2 planes that we flew from Newcastle to Dalaman. The flights themselves were comfortable (not much turbulence). I had no problems with collecting my luggage. Overall I would highly recommend Pegasus.

All seats seemed very old and could have done with a good clean! The service wasn't particularly bad but I wouldn't say it was good either. If I have a choice I won't be flying with them again.

Free WIFI throughout the terminal as in MCO.

Southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. Over the past couple of years I have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground check-in staff. They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked. Would I fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business.,Passive
" Singapore to Hong Kong. Singapore Airlines is usually my family's airline choice because of the great service, seats and special assistance (I travel with a wheelchair with a Yamaha motor and battery). Checking in going to Hong Kong and leaving took a while due to the staff being unfamiliar with the chair. The check in staff going did not not pass information to the gate agent was asked the same questions again. When we landed in Hong Kong, the wheelchair had a bit of damage but was settled by the ground staff. Upon return, we were told to wait somewhere for the wheelchair but it turned out to be at baggage reclaim. Both flights were very good despite the issues on the ground which I wouldn't blame Singapore airlines for. The cabin pressure on the A350 was minimal compared to other aircraft. If you need special assistance traveling I would recommend flying on Singapore airlines.",Promoter
I was scheduled to fly from BKK through AUH to LHR. Etihad run a 'tight' connection at AUH and on this last trip the whole process was a shambles. Their flight into BKK was very late and Etihad suggested that we would not make the AUH connection to LHR. I spent a lot of time (and money) on calls trying to resolve commitments in the UK accordingly. In the end rather than pay for accommodation and similar for (I estimate) 100 passengers they simply made the AUH flight wait two hours and thus inconvenienced over 300 passengers! Investigating their schedules and the way they handle their aircraft (in this case A6ETB) it was clear that they had elected to deliberately run this aircraft late for three consecutive days. When I say late I mean hours not minutes: you can imagine the difficulties that passengers face arriving at LHR and getting out around 10 pm at night rather than at 7 pm. I would and urge everyone who is considering using Etihad to be quite careful they may have an equipment shortage or simply be electing to mess people around as they know that there is limited legislation for a non-EU airline of this nature.,Detractor

"Los Angeles to Siem Reap via Guangzhou with China Southern Airlines. We had an A380 from LAX to Guangzhou, and an A320 from there to Siem Reap. We were lucky to get the upper deck on the A380 where my wife and I took advantage of the 2 seats next to each other giving her a window and myself the aisle. Boarding surprisingly quick and orderly we boarded the plane through the upper entrance. Our seats had adequate legroom, a very nice HD inflight entertainment system and the seats were fairly comfy. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and spoke adequate English. The flight to CAN was fine and I managed to sleep. The food served was fine and there was a selection of beverages including alcoholic drinks. I had no issue getting a refill at any time. There were only 2 toilets on the top deck for Economy which was just about right, unfortunately the rear staircase was closed the whole flight, so other lavatories could not be accessed. The connection in Guangzhou was a couple of hours - it is a horrible airport with few food choices, dark and dingy with little to do. The dining choices that are available are expensive. The flight to Siem Reap had to be boarded by airstairs and we were bussed half way across the airport which was uncomfortable. Once onboard, the flight was fine and we were even offered a decent meal. Seats were fine and service was good. Two peculiarities were that you could not view your location on the inflight entertainment system on the A380, one cannot use a mobile even in airplane mode and all PAs were made by the crew.

"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.",Promoter

In our case, the single escalator leading up to the Gate 40-59 waiting area was out of service, so 180 passengers per flight times 19 gates meant over 3400 people were trying to ascend a single staircase.

A321 was newly-painted in AA colors, and immaculate inside though seven years old. The cabin was quite spacious, and didn't seem cramped despite being a full flight. I did not miss the lack of AV monitors, though I like to see the flight path images on my trips. Two complimentary beverage service runs up to PHX, and snacks/breakfast food was available for sale o board. Service on board was efficient and adequate, with pleasant staff. The same aircraft continued to PDX after a one-hour stop in PHX, with a complimentary beverage and snacks for sale run. Flight attendants did several rounds to check seat belts, and also to collect trash on both segments. Arrived on time in PDX and my bag was on the carousel reasonably quickly. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight and the fare paid.",Promoter
BRU-FLR. Online check-in did not work as ticket was issued on Lufthansa resulting in having bad seats. Cabin crew made the pleasant and the stewardess apologized for the bad seats.

Flew first time with Ryanair it was my son's wedding in Poland and crucial we all arrived on time. Excellent service from start to finish. Panic set in when we arrived at security and we had no bar-codes on boarding cards so couldn't be scanned but problem soon sorted by sending us through check in. Cabin crew helpful finding seats and storing bags that wouldn't fit in nearby lockers. Read the rules follow instructions and you won't have any trouble. No excuses as they make the conditions perfectly clear. Shall certainly be travelling with them again.,Promoter
Flying from Cancun Mexico to Denver. Spent 45 minutes at gate waiting for maintenance to repair a tray that wouldn't stay latched. Then another 20 minutes for a refuel. Only two updates on status in the entire hour. Missed the connecting flight. After another 4 hours we here the announcement that the Denver to SLC flight was delayed 30 minutes. Given a card with a phone number to file a complaint or a compliment. The wait times were horrendous and after waiting for 15 to 30 minutes with no answer - we tried this several times. Most recently it said high call volume. Not surprised. Hope we never have to fly Frontier airline again. Staff fairly unconcerned.,Detractor

Once again, waited on taxi forever. Finally parked as far away from terminal as possible. No ramp, had to walk in from outside. Ran as fast as I could. Barely missed connector. Wouldn't pay for hotel or even give me a discount room. Extremely rude and uncaring service. Got to hotel at 1am and was supposed to leave at 8:20 this morning.

" Dubai to Singapore, with business class seated at 12A, the cabin was amazing, nice facilities with good ambience, cabin crews look nice, however some of the cabin crew are very robotic, there was no genuine care or personal touch from them. During the meal service, there was no one asking me to refill the drinks when crews saw my empty whisky glass, is it very expensive? Most of the crews without any anticipations for passengers. I can remember a female crew, when I asked for help to lay the bed back before landing, she asked me to carry her service tray for her, exchange? When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry! All the small details reflected that there is no attention for the customers, but some of the SQ flights I took before was so different! Honestly speaking, I was not comfortable this time and I feel there is no consistency for the cabin crew. Really disappointed this time and not worth as a elite member anymore.",Detractor
Awful experience and even worse customer service. Had a flight from Orlando delayed due to weather in Ft. Lauderdale and final destination in Medellin Colombia. I was told no planes were coming or leaving so we would not miss our connecting flight. We finally took off and landed only to hear from a very rude gate agent that the plane took off early and left me and 20+ other passengers stranded. Mind you they give us 5 minutes from the time our plane landed to the time when we have to be at the gate to board the connecting flight. I was given a discount coupon for a room which was useless since all the rooms were booked. I had to pay 180 dollars for an awful room at a red carpet inn. Also they change gates and departing times while you are at 36000 feet! Save yourself the hassle and unreasonable rude individuals and just pay a little more.,Detractor

" Shanghai to Hong Kong. I missed the official check in time for flight MU505 to Hong Kong by 3 minutes, which I admit is my fault, but given that a typhoon just hit and raining outside, not much empathy or sympathy by the staff. Without luggage to check in, I had plenty of time to clear customs, security, order a coffee and probably wait another 20 minutes at the gate before boarding starts. Instead the counter rep just says I've missed my flight without suggesting alternatives like ""Let me put you on the next flight or something."" He directed me to 2 separate other counters for no reason then says I have to purchase a new ticket at a premium to change to later flight. Later I found out this was not necessary after I paid. Tried to find the on shift manager and he questioned me by saying if I had bought the ticket at a China Eastern ticketing counter as if I went to the wrong place. As someone from Chinese descent and living in Hong Kong, I wish I could proudly say there's a world class airline from China. Clearly, China Eastern is not currently nor will be one anytime soon.

" Fort Lauderdale to Nashville. JetBlue is perhaps the worst airlines I personally have ever had the displeasure of doing business with. They made the entire group wait 28 1/2 hours with little to no explanation and constant lies and misinformation. No hotel vouchers, no food, and an overbooked flight the next day. I was booked on a Friday flight at 2 PM and started receiving delays of 230 that morning . After arriving to the airport they kept bumping our flight due to a flight delay elsewhere. Then when the plane arrived they changed our gate we all rushed down there to find out that our pilots had left. After two hours more of waiting we were told that the pilots had arrived but the weather was then too bad. After six hours of waiting I decided to go home and rebook on the next flight out which was the same time the next day when the weather was to be beautiful. Thank goodness I live close by and I could do this. Most of the passengers had an awful time trying to get hotels in the area and of course they had to pay for them! The next day I went back for the same terrible treatment. I was told it was going to be an hour late before I got to the airport, then after I was at the airport another mishap and the plane was out of service With no replacement. We were told it would be another 3 to 5 hours of waiting. I was to attend a surprise birthday party for my cousin at 6 o'clock and the plane wouldn't even be arriving until 830 so with a half an hour drive I would miss it entirely! People missed weddings because of this debacle. Southwest never skipped a beat and kept going through all of the weather and had no delays at all from Fort Lauderdale to Nashville. I will never use JetBlue again. They offered me nothing but a refund on my ticket. Nothing to cover my lost rental car, my hotel for two nights, or the grief and embarrassment over not making it to our family gathering. Never again!",Detractor

"  New York to Kuala Lumpur via Guangzhou. I decided to try China Southern as the tickets were well-priced. After flying to and from NYC with them, I have decided the lower fare is not worth it. All flights never left on time. They never communicated any delays but kept us waiting at the gate each time. Guanzhou to NYC was delayed three hours and we could only tell because the time kept changing on the screen. Finally, onboard, the captain would mention some kind of mechanical issue. Communications in general are terrible. Don't even bother trying to get hold of someone before you fly. Customer service is non-existent. No one could tell me why I could select a seat on one leg but not the other of the same trip. The seats were uncomfortable. There was no entertainment from Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou. No personal screens at all. Headphones were terrible quality. The meals were edible but never good. The flight attendants did their job but most may as well have been robots. I guess if you just base it on price, China Southern is okay. But if you are doing a 24 hr flight as I was, you might want to be on a better more customer-oriented airline. It's a whole day you will never get back.",Passive

Air Europa didn't want to approve support for a night hotel (nor dinner or breakfast) and their attitude and service was unacceptable and rude. We had to cover our expenses that night.

"  How is the following acceptable? I've been at Denver airport waiting 10 hours for a connecting flight to Salt Lake City when I learned there was an earlier flight to SLC. I asked if it was possible to change my flight to this earlier departure in the event that there were any no-shows. With 15 open seats and only 5 people in standby I was told that I could move to the earlier flight if I paid a rebooking fee of $99. That doesn't make sense to me. Open seats? Already a paying ticket holder? To top things off, my original flight has been delayed 2 hours. So my legitimate question is this: how is it acceptable to charge someone a fee to for the inconvenience of making a few key strokes and mouse clicks to get them on a flight with plenty of open seats, then in return, after actually causing a real inconvenience to me, expect things to be settled with a simple â€œwe're sorry for the delayâ€?

"My wife and I had booked seats on a flight leaving Cancun Airport on Feb 21st with a connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia Airport in NYC. This flight was delayed one hour in Cancun because of weather problems in Detroit. Delayed we eventually reached Fort Lauderdale but had to clear customs. Presumably due to customs- related delays in Fort Lauderdale the connecting flight to NYC took off stranding 101 passengers. We were not given any official explanation as to why the connecting flight took off without us. We were advised to re-book our flights and were told that the soonest available seats were for Feb 24th (72 hours later). For Boston the lay-over was 96 hours with the soonest available seats on Feb 25th. There was no management representation at Fort Lauderdale and there was a justifiably angry group of stranded passengers. When asked about hotel accommodations we were advised to find our own and that there would be no compensation. When asked about assistance in locating seats on other airlines we were similarly advised that they wouldn't be able to assist us. Since my wife and I weren't able to wait the 72 hours we spent the night in the airport trying to locate seats on an other carrier (which we knew would have to pay for). We got seats on a JetBlue flight the following morning paying the full non-discounted fare which was considerable. The major problem was the connecting flight not waiting for us to clear customs in Fort Lauderdale. Why would the flight not wait for 101 people? I've been flying for more than 40 years and had to wait on many an occasion for other passengers' connections and other reasons which is par for the course. This was an extremely poor management decision which showed a complete disregard for Spirit Airlines' customers. This was then exacerbated by the lack of any meaningful assistance rendered on the ground. I realize that Spirit Airlines is a ""discount (i.e. cheap) airline. However any successful business knows that its fortunes rise or fall with its customer relations. If there was a ""crewing"" issue (not being able to hold airlines staff beyond a certain time) this should have been anticipated in the airlines normal operations plan with staff back-up in Fort Lauderdale-after all this is the winter and hence presumably Spirit Airlines' busy season. This was our first trip with Spirit. However due to the airline's extremely poor management decision coupled with its complete lack of meaningful customer support I could not possibly recommend this airline to anyone. In general you get what you pay for but even a discount carrier needs to appreciate its customers especially in difficult circumstances. By the way I was going to discuss this matter on the phone with a customer services representative but they kept me waiting for 45 minutes.",Detractor

" Shannon to Las Vegas via New York. We get on the flight in JFK and hit bad weather. Aviation rules say they let us off after 3 hours of sitting on the tarmac. It took 4 hours. There were a lot of us traveling and my brothers San Diego flight took off within minutes of them unloading our plane. The captain said the crew on our plane would time out in the air to Las Vegas so they just cancelled our flight. My in laws on a flight to Phoenix were also brought back to the terminal because their captain timed out. The best delta could do was get us home by midnight the next night via a ton of transfers but couldn't leave jfk until 2 the next afternoon as all flights were sold out. Then I find a San Diego flight that was supposed to leave at 7:25 but it's delayed until 12:40 so we get that flight because it's close enough. The soonest they can get us out of San Diego is 5 pm. I'm on the phone with delta and the lady talks to me for over 20 minutes. Most of the time on hold. I walked to the gate and asked the ticket agent about getting on the flight he gets us passes before this lady can get me off hold. Not sure what she could have possibly been doing. I decided to purchase tickets on southwest because now I'm getting home on Saturday and I leave again on Tuesday. We are returning from a 3 week trip and just want to be home. I'm also flying with children. We finally get on the San Diego flight but there's no pilot so we don't leave until 1:40 am. But the icing on the cake is that we are given comfort plus seats and I ask for blankets and pillows when we sit down. The flight attendant says she will check when she gets a secondâ€”she was a little frantic over whether a pilot was actually coming. No one helps me so I try to sleep. Get up to use the bathroom and see the entire coach class with blankets and pillows. When I ask again, they are all out. The in laws were loaded on a plane to Atlanta, driven out to the taxi way and then brought back to the gate because the pilot timed out. Why even put the people on the plane?? They can cry weather all they want but the flight I got on had their entire crew time out so they pulled another crew and put them on this flight so we could take off. It's interesting how forth coming these people are with their information. This crew could have been given to the vegas flight. I can't see how it's cost effective to strand 100's of people.

Second experience with Air Canada Rouge. AC 1871 MCO to YUL Feb 28 seat 3A on an Airbus A319. There was no premium class on this flight so all seats are available in the first 3 rows and no other perk than an extra 6 inches of leg room. Cannot use E-Upgrades certificate to get these seats only available for a fee of $30 unless you are lucky and these are the only seat available when you board. Plane was full. Take-off was aborted in the middle of the runway for a faulty alarm apparently we had to go back to gate. After several passengers asked for it one FA passed the water. FA had plastic smiles (not as genuine as my first flight) and seemed very tired. We landed about 90 min late from schedule. I find slim line seats to be uncomfortable after 30 minutes so this delay was not welcome. In addition I wanted to do some work on my computer but as the person in front of me decided to recline his seat I had no room to open the laptop and work on it. Level of service and comfort comparable to Allegiant who offers the flight to BTV for $111. Not at all comparable to AC Main Line service and comfort but price is the same.

The refreshment whilst nice was not substantial and handed out in a rushed manner. However one positive is that the crew phoned ahead for taxis due to the small size of Wagga's airport and distance from the town centre. Flight back to Sydney was on the smaller Q300.

Flight back from Paris to Singapore on an A380 was great excellent cabin staff who were extremely pleasant and helpful with my young children food was good plenty of drinks entertainment was a bit limited for adults but the kids loved it. Overall preferred the Air France flight home more than our unexpected Singapore airlines flight over.,Promoter
"  Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi. How does Etihad get 5 stars rating, when their true standards are more like 3 stars? I chose them because they were the cheapest ticket (even less than China South Airlines!), but wish I had paid more. Seats were truly cramped, and the aircraft looked tattered but worse it was quite dirty. Bathrooms were disgusting near the end of the second flight. Food portions very small and cabin attendants seemed very unhappy to be serving (or not!). Used Qatar Airways last February and they are so much better.",Detractor
"My wife and I flew to Tonga from Auckland on 5th July 2014 and returned 12th July 2014 The aircraft used on both sectors was a 19 year old 767-300. The aircraft was in pretty good order considering it's age. Departure pretty well on time. Friendly staff. Idiotic Bear Grylls safety video. Reasonable selection of audio video. Food awful vegetable frittata Air NZ has been serving for some time now. Return food much better - beef salad or butter chicken. One water round on each flight. ""Kia Ora"" Inflight magazine no longer in every seat back. No more than twelve copies available from magazine rack at forward cabin. Toilets clean and tidy.

"  Short flight from Beijing to Seoul. After reading many rave reviews, this was my first time flying with Asiana and I was not disappointed. Preceding flight from Incheon arrived past the intended boarding time, but not an issue for me as it allowed me more time to drink my Cappuccino from the Costa Coffee at Capital Airport's Terminal 3. Flight departed about 20 minutes late, but landed in Incheon fairly close to the originally intended arrival time. Aircraft was new with comfortable seating and ample legroom. Cabin was fairly cold which is understandable considering the level of humidity throughout Southeast Asia this time of year. Drink refreshments were not offered after takeoff, but a full meal and coffee/tea service followed soon after. Very pleased with the quality and portions of the meal. IFE was entertaining but really didn't get to enjoy it as much considering flight duration was less than two hours. Most importantly, the staff were helpful, positive, welcoming, and accommodating. Only regret is not purchasing my ticket earlier enough so that I could claim a window seat and view the stunning sunset descent/landing into ICN. Overall, an extremely comfortable and smooth ride. Very impressed with Asiana and would fly with them again.",Promoter
Luton to Budapest. Aware of the draconian application of the carry on dimensions I measured mine and it complied. Boarding was announced only to be followed by ground agents walking the line and selecting many to fit their bags into the 'box'. I made it with a firm boot but was disgusted to witness an elderly lady failing by a minimum margin. We all helped with plastic bags and someone found a bin liner. Result - lady lost her bag but the PR for Wizz was appalling. Note that they have now changed their baggage policy which is full of anomalies with different dimensions apparently qualifying as 'free' as well as a myriad of complications. Be warned- this is a money making scam. Good news is that I have booked another flight to Budapest with easyjet and it was cheaper!,Detractor
Our flight from Bangkok to Dubai was on the newer A380 and was half empty in Business class. The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great. I am vegetarian and I was struggling to find anything on the menu. I ended up having just a starter and dessert. They were both tasty but I am surprised that they did not offer any main meals without meat.,Promoter

"  Bangkok to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. Below the better business class experience. After 1,5 hours airborne, meal service finally commenced. Annoyingly late when you want to catch up with some sleep too. The soup was tepid and the spoon missing, had to wait another five minutes to get cabin crew's attention. The pasta was dry. No refill of glasses, made it even more dry. Had to ask again and wait another ten minutes before the wine bottle came by. No amenity bag, but ear plugs offered on request! Cost saving measure? Cabin crew seemed to be a bit inexperienced and swamped. Not visible in cabin other when rushing back and forth to seats, which may explain they were on a minimum number. More cost cutting? The Miracle lounge prior to departure was okay, rather a bar with snacks than a fully fledged business lounge. The outbound flight was okay but not any of the ""wow"" experiences I have had in the past with other airlines. Altogether, not overly impressed. I could recommend compared to KLM or any American airline, but compared to Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways, no.",Passive
Flew CAI-DXB-CAI Boeing 777-300ER on all sectors. Outbound was first day of Eid loads in Y could not have been more than 60 people. Very pleasant flight cabin crew friendly and efficient. Hot towels and a menu with 2 options lamb kofta or chicken. Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests. The service and EK Y product is what really makes a difference and of course the added advantage of flying non-stop as opposed to connecting.,Promoter
BOM-DEL-BOM. Boarding was swift and passengers greeted by friendly cabin crew. The flight left on time and the service friendly with enough information was given by FA's.

"Very disappointed with Sunwing all around. Booked a ""direct"" return flight (April 27 - May 9) Edmonton - Montego Bay. It turns out the advertised direct flight made a stop in Calgary to pick up more people and stopped on the way back as well to let people off. We paid the extra $$$ for Elite seating yet those seats (1a and b) had no extra leg room and were not wider as stated for elite booking. The aircraft was very very old and so small that it could only offer ""Bistro Service"" in other words sandwiches. The 10 hour return flight was brutally uncomfortable. Their customer service department could not care less when I wrote a complaint. Sunwing has lost our business for life.",Detractor

"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent. Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised! The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch.

Stansted to Pula. Tried to adhere to all rules and regulations but failed to print boarding passes for return journey and hence fined â‚¬240 for family of four. This was a genuine error caused by my printing off the outbound boarding passes at too early a stage in my eagerness to do all correctly at which time unable to print for return. Erroneously assumed outbound copies and itinerary would suffice. Hold my hands up and agree nominal fine should be payable but believe that â‚¬60 per person is totally disproportionate to administration involved for the error.

"  Copenhagen to Brisbane via Singapore. SAS Lounge in CPN comfortable and food looked OK, was not sure re wine out of a tap and so left this alone. The only other alcohol in the Business Class lounge was beer. Flight left on time and crew started working down one side of the Business Class cabin almost immediately, the other side took substantially longer. In any case the crew were helpful, the food was fine and the seat comfortable. Wine was good and topped up. A short stay in the lounge at Changi T3 and then re-boarded the same plane at the same gate (different flight number). Crew still fine but food was not up to scratch, the steak was very overcooked to the point of being really tough. The vegetables were mush, I didn't eat much and the crew member asked if I wanted anything else but I went to sleep instead. Supper coming into Brisbane was better. Waited 25 minutes for one bag in BNE, the other didn't arrive. Filled in the details at the airport. Have not heard back, no one answers the baggage service phone although you can leave a message that no one responds to as well. Calling Singapore Airlines they give you the number for Menzies Aviation that you have already called, they also mentioned that they would call back but have not. The online bag track system has had the same message on it for 6 days. In all the standard here is not commensurate with the full business class fare paid. The main advantage of the flights was being able to sleep, arriving on time is good but not when you are without your luggage and the follow up is so poor.",Detractor
Singapore - Nice return on a business trip with a transit in Dubai both ways. Overall the quality of the trip was good. Seats comfortable slide suite doors a bit gimmicky but definitely help with privacy / quietness for sleeping. Didn't eat on all legs but when I did the quality of the a la carte food was excellent. Drinks list wide. ICE system has great content but the tablet style controller is sometimes unresponsive. In flight wifi / mobile connectivity only available on one leg out of four which was disappointing as the one leg that had it was a night leg when I wanted to sleep! Emirates First lounge in DXB very comfortable. All flights on time. Only complaints are that the cabins seemed too warm and that Dubai airport remains a bit of a mess for transit. Might be better when all construction works complete. Price for this First trip was barely any higher than Singapore Airlines Business class to Europe so on that basis the value for money is good. This is a regular trip for me and I'd consider EK next time.,Promoter
Seats quite comfy good legroom cabin clean. Flight attendants attentive and polite although English is not their strong point. Meals were decent although it felt quite rushed during meal times.

Had the breakfast pack for inflight service for what amounted to AUS$13 and though it was reasonable value. Return flight through immigration security at CPH and left pretty much on time at 7pm the same day. Wanted to buy a sandwich and a beer for 108 kroner and wanted to pay with cash (I had the exact change) but alas they only take credit card. Flight time announced be the captain was 105 mins but ended up only being about 90 mins. Seat 1C both ways was OK with extra legroom for the extra price. Cabin crew functional.

I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,Promoter

Worst trip ever. Flight was cancelled due to fire in air traffic control in Chicago (not the fault of Spirit). However the customer service was horrendous. The next day I checked in and the manager was training 5 new employees. The manager was taking her time to show them the process step by step and made me jump through hoops to show them how a customer checks luggage to make sure it's the right size.

"  London Heathrow - Abu Dhabi - Sydney and return in the First class apartment. The apartment is superb. Much more refined than the Emirates suite, and in a different league from Qantas or BA First. The separate seat and bed set-up is excellent, there's a great feeling of spaciousness, and lots of storage. The vanity unit is a nice touch. The whole thing exudes class. Unfortunately I didn't find the bed desperately comfortable. It is extremely hard, even for someone who likes a firm bed. They need to invest in some thicker mattresses to deal with this as a priority. The shower is good, though not close to the quality of the EK bathrooms. Amenity kits were nothing special and didn't include deodorant. When I used my own, the spray set off the smoke detector and I was interrupted when only half-dressed by three crew members rather aggressively demanding to know if I was having a cigarette while showering. The toilet lighting was very dim on all four sectors which was a bit frustrating. The on board chefs were all exceptional in their attitude, and happy to make bespoke dishes (within reason), the F&B managers more varied and I didn't really see the point of them. Other crew were consistently very good indeed. IFE was ok with a pretty good selection of recent and older films. Transfers in AUH were speedy (though not well signposted) but First Class priority at security was not open. The (shared business and First) lounge at LHR was quite small but ok. Spa treatments for First passengers complimentary. AUH lounge not especially spacious either but with spa where I enjoyed an excellent massage and paid a small amount for a traditional shave (which was superb). A la carte breakfast was very good. SYD business and First lounge pleasant but no spa. Very friendly staff. Flights on time and any issues always explained. One big annoyance - at check in in Sydney I spotted that my confirmed seat had been changed to a much less attractive one. The senior customer service representative couldn't work out why and after several conversations and calls discovered a couple travelling together wanted to be in adjacent seats, but hadn't reserved ahead. They had persuaded somebody senior, who should have known better, to displace me without asking. I was extremely displeased, not least that the change had been made unilaterally, for non-operational reasons. I had it changed back and received an apology from the agent (though not the person responsible), but it left a sour taste. Overall, however, easily now my favourite first class, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.",Promoter
Uncomfortable seat on a flight between Delhi to Peking (and then again upon return). No in-flight entertainment. Very bad food. Staff courtesy below par.

All apart really cannot understand why the food should be so bad especially since the Chinese cuisine/food is so good. Even if they are adjusting tastes for international passengers their standard meals should be better not something that's unfit to be served!,Detractor

Cancun-DFW flight 0748 on 3/29/15 DFW-Denver flight 0719 on 3/29/15. I felt Spirit was OK in general but they still hide fees. After decades of flying certain processes seem to be second nature for most travelers and you tend to assume things will be familiar however Spirit makes baggage and seat assignments more costly than you would think even if you read all the 'fine print'. While I picked the cheapest option for checked baggage nowhere did I see that Spirit's weight limit is 40 pounds per bag or about 20% less than the industry standard of 50 pounds. This resulted in bigtime overweight charges on all of my family's bags. The seat assignment fee was a bigger surprise. You assume that choosing 'better' seats will cost more (up front more legroom first class) but Spirit did not let me select seats until we were confirming within 24 hours of our flights and only then did it became apparent that you have to pay for any seat that you want assigned! So if you want your family of five all together and not spread around randomly you need to pay for each and every seat even if it is the poorest seat on the plane! You have to pay for every leg and pay the rate for whatever seats are left which might be the most expensive on the plane. So for the family of 5 on a connecting flight you could pay $400 or more to just get the privilege of sitting together.,Passive

Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements. Nice experience and nice product and great crew.,Promoter

The flight attendants refused to tell ignorant people in front to put their seats upright whilst my row tried to eat. The flight was delayed 2 hrs and gate changed twice, seats dreadfully uncomfortable. Will never fly American Airlines again.",Detractor
"  London to Taipei via Guangzhou, with an overnight stopover. I booked to travel during the Chinese New Year period, so it was already quite expensive even to fly with China Southern Airlines (usually the cheapest option). However I felt I really got my money's worth. The overnight hotel provided was luxurious (Dragon Lake Princess Hotel), the food was good, the staff at both the airport and the hotel very helpful in assisting with the stopover. The film selection onboard the flight was incredible. Only one bad thing, the economy seats in the Boeing 787 (used for the London-Guangzhou flight) are absolutely tiny - I found that the seats for the much shorter Guangzhou-Taipei flight (A330) were much more comfortable. Cabin staff are very friendly and speak good English, the toilets very clean. I'd definitely recommend China Southern Airlines.",Promoter

The agent made us check the weight of every single bag we had, even hand bags, we consolidated and reconsolidated, checked 3 bags and paid the extra costs for the bags and still Alitalia lost our luggage.

She was very friendly throughout the flight. I believe China Southern Airlines' flight attendants were really the ones that made the experience pleasing.",Promoter
" Providence to Dallas via Washington DC. Both flights departed on time with no issues in the boarding process and/or during in flight. Service was typical of Southwest. Flight Attendants come around and take your order for drinks and service snacks. Both flights were on B737-700. On the PVD-DCA leg, there was enough leg room to seat in comfort. The same could not be said for the DCA-DAL leg. The seating area felt cramped even though this was the same type of aircraft we flew in on from Providence.",Passive

  London to Chennai via Bahrain. The fare was very cheap compared to other airlines. The aircraft are of an average standard and quite old. Inflight entertainment is very bad and boring. Staff are pleasant and accommodating. Food is also of average standard. The biggest issue with Gulf Air is the punctuality. I have been checking some of the flights since I booked my ticket and on several occasions the LHR bound flight had been delayed by more that 2 hours. The outbound flight was uneventful however the inbound flight from Chennai to Bahrain was delayed by 1 hour and even more frustrating to find that the Bahrain - London flight was delayed by 2 hours.

My wife also works for different airlines so I can say we are frequent flyers and can give you honest review. We fly to Poland 1-2 times a year and we never had any problems.

LOT is almost always on schedule - are there delays? of course like everywhere else and not always because of the airlines itself, there are many factors that cause delays. Food comparing to many other airlines is very good. They serve a lot, quick and leave people alone so you can rest. If you need anything, ask for service - simple as that.

No compensation for this delay was provided. Planes felt quite old seating space really small and lacking cushioning no space in seat back to put your things pop-down TV's outdated static sound and food was of poor quality.

"QF74, economy from San Francisco to Sydney. Seats 70A/70B. Late departure from SF with additional delay due to anticipated tail winds with same eta. Newer updated 747 configuration. Again good levels of service both on ground and during flight from this carrier. More experienced flight crew and generally improved level of service than previous outbound trip. Given night flight - limited service requirements. Inflight food was also better than previous flight. On time arrival with some turbulence due to weather conditions but generally very smooth, efficient flight. Recommend for two up travelling seating from row 69 - 73 on either side of aircraft, two only seats with extra storage space on side. Also believe this new fit-out provides increased legroom in economy than A380 - seat base still not comfortable for long flights. Overall Qantas again has proven to be a dependable, quality carrier.",Passive
We were hesitant on booking with Air France from Toronto to Bangalore via Paris after looking at the reviews. We were quite pleased with almost everything. The inflight service was fantastic. The seats were as comfortable as any other airline. Inflight entertainment was good. The only complaint I have is the boarding process in Paris. They do not board by row numbers. They have everyone board at the same time causing utter chaos. We chose seats at the back of the aircraft and always ended up boarding in the middle. We paid the extra for the 2 seats which were good. On our return we chose not to and sat in the row in front of the two seats. Inflight meals were good as well.

The Silver Air flight was also delayed and a propeller plane that seats 36 people. Not what we paid for. Jetblue response was a $25 goodwill credit. That is more of an insult to me.

An online-form where I had to fill in my visa details for China got stalled. But things where quickly sorted out by the check-in attendant.

" Atlanta to San Francisco. One of the most inconsiderate customer service experiences that I've ever had before with United Airlines! My family and I booked a one way flight from Atlanta to Reno, NV where we were catching a connecting flight in San Francisco on 7/10/18. After boarding the flight in Atlanta at 7:35a, we sat in our designated seats for nearly an hour due to mechanical difficulties that they were having with the plane. When nearing San Francisco, the pilot and his flight attendants informed us that we were behind schedule by 25 minutes but he had informed the supervisor of our late arrival due to multiple passengers with tight connecting flights that were boarding while we were still in flight. Our flight landed at 10:17am. Due to the pilot landing at the wrong gate, we sat on the plane an additional 10 minutes before they finally allowed us to exit which was approximately 10:25a. Our connecting flight also with United Airlines allowed passengers to board between 10:15a and stopped boarding at 10:25a. Again, we were under the impression that our flight was being held for us. Upon approaching the gate, the 2 people at the gate and customer service desk were the absolute rudest and the most inconsiderate. They stated that they never got word from the pilot about our late arrival. They attempted to split my family (my husband, myself, and our 7yo son) apart to catch different flights then recanted and stated that they were full. Our son is competing in the USA National Karate Competition in Reno, NV and had to be checked in by 4pm. We explained that to them. Still no remorse or apology or anything. Instead, they attempted to book us for a 9:30p flight which we refused. The only thing left for us to do as parents was to rent a car and tackle the 4hr drive! Of course the rental was over priced because it was last minute and being dropped off in a different state! This whole experience was absolutely horrible!",Detractor

" Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage. They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn't even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Detractor

Crew were very friendly and professional throughout the flight. We were on time as always with Ryanair, and for Â£20 return I can't complain.",Promoter
"Ground staff for KLM was unnecessarily unfriendly and insisted she weigh our carry-on although it was a tiny rucksack. We were well within the weight limit. On our check-in luggage one of the bags was 1.8kgs over the limit and the lady at the counter insisted we redistribute our luggage, although our second bag was more than 3kgs under the limit. To sum up, annoying, unfriendly and unprofessional experience, I had the feeling she was just trying to give us a hard time for nothing. I will avoid KLM and Delta in future due to this and other sub-par experiences in the past.",Detractor
"  Flew Stockholm to London. This airline has an almost non existent customer service, if you should ever have any issues with your booking. I tried to recover money for over 1 year when they charged me 3 times for one ticket. I probably spent near 6 hours on recovering the money. Regarding the actual flying. The staff are usually nice but it's a low price airline experience. With the only difference that SAS usually have older planes and more expensive food. I only recommend flying SAS if there is no other alternative. I have flown SAS a lot and is a gold tier traveller as Star Alliance. Norwegian and Easyjet are far better than SAS, but Ryanair is possibly worse, however at a fraction of the price.",Detractor
My worst flight was 2 weeks ago with United. My original flight was re-routed due to delays and not being able to make my connection. My re-routed trip had a connection which was delayed several times. Several passengers requested clarity to the problem and were given vague excuses and lied to several times. When the final flight was boarding I along with several others were denied boarding as the plane provided was not large enough to accommodate all reservations. I spent that night in the airport and flew to a different location the next day. The staff were unprofessional and created nothing but frustration and anger for many passengers. The planes were uncomfortable and I felt as if we were cattle being driven to our destination. I will never choose United again.,Detractor
I was on flight AMS-MAD-MEX. The airplanes are old but well maintained. Yes you don't have your own inflight entertainment but just bring your own. The seats were very comfortable and you had a lot of leg room (compared to KLM economy class). The climate onboard was wonderful no dry eyes and it was not too hot or too cold. Most of the time when I get out of the plane after a long haul flight I am absolutely wrecked. The food was not that good I must say but who eats these meals anyway? The flight attendants were very kind although sometimes when I asked for a glass of water he would just forget and I had to go out of my seat to get a glass. I must say they looked understaffed. I would definitely fly with Iberia again. The value for money is great.,Promoter
"  Well where do you start. This is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. The ticket price was in excess of Â£5000. The lounges at LHR T5 need work. Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew. Change the catering and get a few more choices. Upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an Olympic pole vaulter.",Detractor
"  Singapore to Prague via Dubai. Extremely lousy service, traveling in a group of 8 and treated rudely.

Controller of mini screen don't come out, ask crew member to help, she pressed several times and replied â€œif you can't take it out I can't tooâ€. Asked whether we want chicken or beef, we said beef, crew member say I will take a look and never come back again. Asked another crew member, he told the previous one that she has missed us, she snapped and walk away. In the end no food was served.

"  Milan to Melbourne via Bangkok. Flying on the A350 was a great experience: Cabin extremely quiet, comfortable seats and very large IFE seatback screens. Excellent range of latest release movies and tv shows. Reclining the seat causes the seat to slide forward, which slightly reduces legroom. Personally I like this, as it means reclining doesn't trouble the person behind. Meals were ok, though not wonderful. The child meal we booked for our daughter (for both sectors) was delivered on the MXP-BKK sector but wasn't loaded on the BKK-MEL sector. Cabin crew on the A350 or at least the one crew member looking after our seat (33A-C) didn't smile once in the 10+ hours on board. She was quite abrupt at times during meal service, which is disappointing and very uncharacteristic for Thai crew. The crew on the second sector were much nicer. Friendly and professional at all times. TG 461 BKK-MEL was a 777. Noisier than the A350 with smaller IFE screens which had much less clarity. The 777 seats are comfortable, though the legroom wasn't as good as the A350. Again, the food was ok though not as good as Thai flights a couple of years ago. Overall a reasonable experience with both flights on-time.",Passive
Birmingham to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew Emirates 5 years ago and was very impressed. What a difference this time. The staff were unsmiling and unfriendly to passengers. Meals were slow and on both legs one of the meal options was not available by the time they got to us. On the second occasion I refused the meal offered as I didn't want another stew and I had had enough. I was eventually provided with the meal I wanted but it was put down with ill grace. My partner is vegetarian but he is not vegan. Surely Emirates could provide for both and not treat vegetarians as vegan? His meals were awful and inadequate and he had to have my cheese and biscuits as he was left hungry.,Passive
A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls. We were fortunate that we were able to complete our journey that day. I am not certain all our fellow abandoned passengers were so lucky. I am afraid I could never trust Air Canada in the future.,Detractor

" Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags.

The agent also told us totally misleading and incorrect baggage allowance information! Not at all in accordance with normal practice for a trans Atlantic flight. The aircraft are decrepit and uncomfortable! Seats did not recline, food was below standard, washrooms filthy, and drunkenness rampant due to crew selling hard liquor for currency at the back of the plane. When we addressed our complaint to them, their only answer was that they would ""take it under advisement and thank you for contacting us"".

I am also tired of opening the seat pocket to find the last traveller's garbage left behind for me - and this on a flight where the pilot accounts for our thirty-minute flight delay because the plane was slow to get through the (overnight) cabin service. This reminded me that it was not my first time on Rouge, having flown between Calgary and Kelowna on this AC service and experiencing the same thing once in the past.

I sat in one seat and noticed the jack for the headphones would not accept my personal noise cancelling headphones or even the airlines' own headphones. The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all.

LGW-LPA-LGW. April 2013 - To be honest I wish BA would start flying to LPA direct as it would make things much easier but as it stands you've got either easyjet or ryanair and I would say (after many flights) that easyjet does have the advantage on this route by a small margin.,Passive
HKG-TPE. I have travelled several times with Cathay Pacific and I am always very impressed with their service. On my return flight I arrived early at the airport. At the check-in they told me that my flight was slightly delayed. Because they feared that I might miss my connection to Europe in Hong Kong they automatically rebooked me on the flight one hour earlier very professional! The flight experience itself was as always impeccable.,Promoter
"  Mumbai to Tokyo Narita with ANA in a B787 configured in only two classes. Cabin interior was welcoming and immaculately maintained. The Business Class configuration is among the best, allowing for a degree of privacy not offered in most other airlines. Service levels were exceptional strengthening ANA's reputation as one of the top 5 airlines in the world. The flight attendants were attentive yet discreet.

"11/11/2013 my companion and I flew from San Antonio to Chicago and there caught Aer Lingus Flight EI124. The Aircraft was an Airbus 330. The Senior Crew Flight attendant was a very compassionate woman who attended to us and all of those around us with interest and tenacity. The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44"" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well. We had the same seats on the opposite side of the cabin. The amenities of even economy class on this Airline are excellent and a great value. The equipment is first class and the crew made me proud to be Irish American.",Promoter
I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. If you are booking a cheap flight their service may be fine but when you book an all inclusive vacation with Air Canada and have to pay for baggage check-in food and entertainment it is not acceptable. The seats were uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight. $10 to rent an I-pad for entertainment. No in flight music or movie without the rental. Not everyone has an I-pad or takes it on their vacation. Pre- booking seats can only be done by calling Air Canada and waiting on line for 45 minutes or longer. I will never book another Vacation with Air Canada.,Detractor
"  Flew CPH-SVO-SGN on 12 March. Flew on A320 and B777-300ER, respectively. Faultless, new aircrafts. 100% punctual. Not much pleasures onboard apart from an OK working IFE system on the long sector only. Very strict at check-in in CPH and had to rearrange luggage twice as to meet practiced requirements as they deny more than 10 kg hand-luggage. I had no privileges in their FFProgramme, so could not claim much rights, apart from being entitled to 23 kg according to the tickets which was very cheap (450 USD return, purchased online almost a year earlier. 6 months ticket). Service onboard mediocre on the short haul, but for the price paid, you'll survive. Transfer in Moscow very quick and smooth, less than 5 Minutes for security and immigration check. On the long haul to SGN (12 hours+) hot meals (2-3 options!) and drinks/wines were served for the first half of the flight until they â€œran outâ€ (not true, its merely cost saving or fear of drunks). Hot meals were very good: supper service offered 2 options and breakfast 3 hot options. Wines were surprisingly good, to my taste they were excellent and well chosen. IFE the best I have encountered and easy to operate. Good value for money, but please travel light. Got 75% miles to their FFP, which will be enough to a long-haul upgrade after 3-5 more legs. Staff onboard professional though appear more cynical than truly caring. Load in economy approx. 75% full for both flights. Was lucky and had 4 seats in a row to stretch out though next to the toilets. Luggage delivery in Saigon took 1Â½ hour, likely the service provider messed up. Good alternative and challenge to Middle East Carriers. Will go again, especially when cost saving is an issue",Promoter

"c Washington to Panama City. We made 3 different phone calls and spoke to 3 different staff members to get clarification on their unaccompanied minor policies and the staff seemed very unfamiliar and we got the impression their main concern was to force us to change our $300 tickets for new $2000 tickets. They gave us a hard time regarding the departure flight and when that didn't work they gave us a hard time regarding the return flight. The two points of contention come from their own website: https://www.copaair.com/en/web/us/minors-travelling-alone ""The payment of the unaccompanied minor service can be made 48 hours before the departure of the flight through our Sales Offices and Reservation Center."" According to COPA, the above means we must call 48 hours before and submit the request for unaccompanied minor. We called 24 hrs in advance. The issue here is that the kids are flying in a direct flight. They do not have a companion service. We are dropping them off at the gate and they are being picked up at the gate in their destination, calling 24 hours in advance to provide names, phone numbers, etc. has always been sufficient in the past but now they said we missed our window, we were supposed to call 48 hrs in advance and we need to change our ticket. We called again and the two other staff members did not interpret the rule like that, and said 24 hrs was fine. ""For connecting flights, unaccompanied minor service is not offered if the minor's itinerary includes a flight that is the last flight of the day at the connection point, unless the flight is the only flight of the day."" According to COPA if you are flying direct from Panama to Dulles, this rule applies. We pointed out that this is not a connecting flight, it is a direct flight and the rule should not apply. One of the staff members we spoke to agreed with us, the other 2 said the website was wrong. The point here is that if there is no connecting flight, there is no concern of missing a flight and the kids being stranded in a connecting city. For staff members not to know the difference between a connecting and a direct flight is appalling.",Detractor

" Boston to Phoenix. Purchased first class but on return trip was re-booked for the following day in coach seats after 9 hours of delay and 2 times boarding and deplaning!

Nine hours in the airport with nothing more than water and chips or granola bars after the first deplaning. All the food service in the airport was closed by this time because it was late.The airline only refunded a fraction of what I have calculated to be fair (the difference between the first class seat purchased and the coach seat assigned). American booked passengers in hotels nearby but the dinner vouchers were worthless since it was 10:30 pm by the time we were re-ticketed and left the airport. I filed my first partial refund request through American Airlines website on August 21st--a month ago.

After I insisted on a phone number for ""Customer Relations"" she gave me a toll free number that was no longer working! Hard to believe that wasn't intentional.

NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked.

Booked our trip from the Bahamas to Canada on May 15th from Air Canada. After hearing about Rouge I wondered and checked the reservation. It was Air Canada Rouge where the seats have been taken out replaced with cheaper shorter seats with no inflight entertainment or even a plug and they have added 2 rows. Not wanting to endure that flight with nothing to do I loaded the laptop with stuff to watch. We boarded and found out the man in the window seat had taken my aisle seat. After we fixed that I found out why. He said he had been flying Air Canada for 22 years and had never had that little leg room. After we were in the air I pulled out the laptop case from under my feet and found out I did not have enough room to open it. I slid it into the aisle to open was told not to do that but got the laptop out. I pulled out my tray put the laptop on it opened the laptop to find out there wasn't enough room to open the screen high enough to view it. I am a thin woman so I pulled the tray into my chest and the laptop closer too. That worked and I watched a movie the whole flight. Every time somebody went down the aisle they hit my seat which jabbed the laptop into my chest a bit more. I can no longer fly the real Air Canada to the Bahamas WestJet flies there too and they have normal legroom and inflight entertainment.,Detractor

"  I travelled on July in Aeromexico from Mexico to Narita Tokyo - I had never had such a problems I found travelling in Aeromexico. For me it was the worst experience I had from an international airline. On July 4th from Tokyo to Mexico DF, the service was kind of self-service. I felt like the Aeromexico crew was acting as ""divas"" and we passengers, we were just the audience. They provided us some dinner then we had to wait almost one hour before the arrival to Tokyo to get another meal. Some people stand up to ask what happened with the meal, as almost all people were hungry. They said there was no problem, ""everything was under control"". Some snacks were provided at the back of the plane, however there was no information about this until you discovered them. On July 28th, the way back from Mexico to Tokyo was the longest flight in my life, as 2 or 3 hours after taking-off, they announced there was an electrical problem, not serious at all however we would need more fuel, so we were on the way to Guadalajara to refuel. This took two additional hours of a 12 hours flight! Also, the maintenance of one of the restroom was not good, as one of the toilet's lid couldn't stand on the tank, so for women we had to use it with the toilet lid standing on our back. I could not imagine how men did, to use this toilet. When I reported the problem to one person of the staff, the Aeromexico staff affirmed that restroom was working well, as she thought I was talking about a problem of flushing it. Then I showed her the toilet lid problem, she said: ""Oh, yeah"". Maybe for her it was not a problem! Additionally, one of the staff spilled some coke almost on me, the internal communication between staff on the plane, I heard one treating each other as ""cabron"", which shows again the non-professional staff working in Aeromexico. When they knew I could understand Spanish, they decided to move somewhere else to talk, and instead of being attentive to their passengers, they keep chitchatting during the flight. Aeromexico staff have no notion of in-flight service and service is at not all on the standards of a Skyteam airline. I won't take any Aeromexico flight again.",Detractor
"  Boston to Cancun via Myrtle Beach and Ft Lauderdale. I bought this ticket because it offer a one stop to Cancun from Boston and back at a competitive price. After the fact they added a stop which would have meant I would have picked someone else had I known they would do that. The more I found out about them the less I liked them. At one point it seemed that one of our party may not be able to come, in the end they did, but their policy on this is so brutal it is almost that you would lose all you money. You get a credit you need to use in 90 days. Any booked airfare in that short a notice will be brutal. The fees are excessive. There is a fee for picking your seat, there is a fee if your 1 bag on an international flight exceeds 40 lbs. They do not provide water in flight without you having to pay for it. The unprofessionalness of the crew staff on our return flight from was epic. Everything was a joke. The announcements were a joke, they did not take their role seriously. We paid $30 per seat extra to ""pick our seats"" so we could sit together. On the last leg of the flight they asked my 14 year old to move his seat so a family could sit together (free). He was sitting with his friend that we brought with us, and my wife and I were elsewhere on the plane. Sure he could have said no, but he is 14 and said yes. Now we paid for something that Spirit gave away of ours for free. Seats were tiny, once fees and changes came into it price was not a value and the staff were unprofessional. Bottom line, for a quick hop and a short trip maybe this airline can make sense, but if you are going on a real vacation (distance and duration in days) stay away.",Detractor

When I complained I was told that there is nothing that could be done other than refund my ticket and cancel the tripâ€œif I was not happyâ€.

No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable.

" Shanghai to Milan. I just came back from a 2 week trip across China and I found myself flying with Air China multiple times over that span of time. I was skeptical about this airline in the first place, but I had no choice since the flights were already included in the travel packet. What can I say, it lived up to my lowest expectations, and the worst were international routes, especially the one from Milan to Beijing. We flew on an A330 but the aircraft looked as old as the hills and was impossibly noisy, so much so that I had serious trouble following the movies I was watching. Corridors are narrow and the space between seats is very limited and their entertainment offer is mostly made of Chinese movies. On top of that, my monitor was completely dead and there was no way to bring it back to life. I pointed it out to the flight attendants many times and they kept coming and going first trying to fix it themselves and then saying they'd try to reset the whole system, but to no avail. Luckily there was a spare seat in the row in front of me so I moved there, only to find out that the guy who had been previously sitting there had moved away himself because that monitor wasn't working properly either. As it turned out, it was insanely slow and some buttons on the remote weren't working (yeah there were remotes if you're wondering, the ones you pull out of the seat and then back in), but hey that was as good as it went! The service was virtually non existent - the crew only stopped by twice for meals and that was it. If you wanted water you had to look for them yourself and ask for it and they would come and pour you a glass of water. As for the food, I didn't touch anything because it was terrible. Overall it made for a very uncomfortable flight. A guy sitting next to me told me he had flown with Air China in the past for work, but he didn't recall it to be that bad and that the aircraft looked the same as the one he had flew in 10 years ago. This said, it should hardly be surprising that I was dreading the idea of having to take internal flights as I was expecting those aircrafts to be even older. I was pleasantly surprised instead since their internal routes turned out to be much better. The aircrafts were just regular airbuses and they were quiet enough. Oh one more thing, the pilots' English is barely understandable, I'm no native speaker but I'm fluent in English so I don't have any trouble with listening, but these pilots are the worst! Flight attendants are slightly better, but don't venture beyond basic stuff or else you'll lose them. In summary, the only plus is that it's is way cheaper than any other airline and offers highly competitive fares, however if you have a choice pick another airline at least for your long-haul flight! With hindsight, I would probably had paid a little bit more and bought the flight with Etihad or Lufthansa, even with a layover.",Passive
 San Antonio to Stillwater. Poor customer service. They do not care about customers. This is first time I have submitted a review but have wanted to before and just haven't. I usually don't complain but tried to rebook a fly got home so I could get home to see my family earlier and they wouldn't allow me even though they had 9+ seats empty on the plane. They said I could buy another ticket but wouldn't allow me to change flight. I'm sure they will screw up my later flight so I still won't make it home today like they have done before but certainly won't let me on earlier flight and would rather fly with empty seats.,Detractor
The aircraft was comfortable and clean and the seats gave generous leg room. The cabin crew were very pleasant and courteous and the flights were punctual. The food served on the flight from Cairo to London was however inedible. I had beef and my wife had chicken and both meals had completely dried up. They had obviously been kept hot for far too long. The food on the outbound flight was slightly better but was still far below the quality I have experienced on other airlines. I make these comments to be helpful as other aspects of the flights were excellent.,Passive
"It has been a considerable time since I flew Qantas and I was pleasantly surprised. Self check-in completed in a very short time. The flight was very enjoyable, being the last flight on a Thursday night. There were few empty seats and happy with comfort on this A330-200, seat 31A. Cabin crew were very pleasant and served a superior snack with beverages or wine. The service was efficient and pleasant. Qantas are far superior to the low cost carriers.",Promoter
"Not sure I have flown with the same airline as most reviewers, but I have to say my wife and I were very happy with Air Canada rouge and will use again. After booking via my bank and reading the feedback on this site we were a bit apprehensive as to what to expect. Need not have worried. Staff whilst less in numbers on board were a great team and did all that I would required on a flight for service and standards. Food was fine and no worse than virtually any other airline we have used. I enjoyed mine and it hit the mark. Entertainment onboard worked fine as long as you are aware you need to download the App in advance or rent an Ipad on board. At $10 (Â£5.04 billed) its fine. Films a bit limited but enough to find something to keep you entertained. Seat size fine and having flown back Lufthansa can honestly say no real difference noted so again do not see peoples issues. Leg room also more than enough. Only real quibble I have is on the lack of duty free and fact website makes no statement to advise if available or not. Will happily use again and for the price paid very happy with what we got. Just a shame they only operate in the summer season but that may change in the future.",Promoter

"  Doha to Amsterdam. This aircraft is the one with the 24 seat business class cabin in a 2X2X2 seat format across. Older aircraft and seat width is not as wide as on the new A380 and A350 at around 20.5 inches for upper part and smaller at the lower section. Fully flat seat but the lower half of the seat has been forced down further from people sitting or putting weight on what is not a very sturdy part of the seat so the seat needed to be raised a little to get it into a comfortable flat bed. However, service was excellent, four crew for 24 passengers with eat when you want from the menu. Breakfast on offer out of Doha and light snacks and meals available then or later with wine etc. before arriving in Amsterdam. Tasty food, nicely presented.",Promoter
VIE-DEL. This was one of the best flights I have ever had. From start to finish the crew food IFE seat exceeded my expectations. The crew was efficient and engaged with a great sense of humour. The seat was well designed though I found the opening to the aisle to be a bit tight. The IFE was amazing with picture clarity that I have never had on an aircraft before. I was told that each seat's unit is self contained and can be replaced by simply popping it out. There is no master server so many of the glitches that are found elsewhere do not occur. The food was excellent and served with pazzazz. I was sorry to arrive and have the experience end. Delightful in every respect.,Promoter

" Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression. Overall the experience of flying with Etihad was just fine, nothing more or less but I would definitely try another carrier for a long-haul flight before ever choosing them again as even though they were the cheapest option it certainly shows.",Passive

I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option.

I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time.

On March 2 2014 we flew back from Puerto Vallarta on Air Canada Rouge (flight A/C 1819). Was it a good experience? No. It was an awful experience. Rouge makes us see red. The seats in the plane were so crammed up that we felt that we were in a can of sardines One of us is 1 m 90 tall Consequently his knees were stuck in the seat in front of him with no way of stretching his legs. Many passengers with mobility issues had a hard time getting out of their seat (e.g: to go to the washroom). Rouge is a poor service and shame on Air Canada for offering it. It shows disrespect to the clientele. We'd rather pay more money to get a better service and have more space. We expect a better service.,Detractor

I am 6'3"" and normally try and book the ""Preferred Seating"" on mainline AC for all my flights just to have the leg/knee room. Flying from YYZ-YUL was mainline AC and I upgraded the day of to Business Class. I think this gave me a false sense of hope for the Rouge portion of the trip. First off the plane (767-300) was disgusting. The plane must have been at least 20-25 years old. It was dirty as can be with seats falling apart in the Premium Rouge cabin. In terms of leg/knee room. It was virtually the same as North American Business Class on mainline AC so more than enough room with decent recline for an over-night flight. Nowhere near the quality of the Pod seats but let's be realistic I paid substantially less for this flight as compared to mainline AC Executive First. Second the staff as described by many others were very friendly young and enthusiastic however that's where the positive reviews end. It took them over 2 hours to serve the first meal/drink service (there were only 5 people in Premium Rouge cabin) and they were very inattentive. The crew gave me the sense that they were not in control of the flight's service whatsoever. Always seemed un-organized and the so called ""Dedicated lead Rouge crew"" for Premium Rouge were non-existent. I did not speak to the same flight attendant more than once. All-in-all this was the worst flight experience I have ever had and I'm saying this knowing full-well what the reviews on Rouge are. I will avoid Rouge at all costs.",Detractor

This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off.

"  I was supposed to fly out of New Delhi to Boston via Frankfurt on 26th November when the pilot strike was extended and I became its latest victim.

I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem.

"Boise to Northwest Arkansas via Dallas Ft Worth. Round trip flight with four legs, first was late, second was canceled twice on two different days, third on time, fourth was late. The canceled flights was the worst. We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that. As soon as we got inside the terminal they announced that the flight was canceled. They also would not give us our luggage, including gate checked luggage, which for us was a wheelchair. Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster. When we asked for our luggage they told us it would be at XNA when we got there. When we asked about lodging and meals we were informed that they have no obligation to provide that for weather related issues. When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue. They did book us on a flight for the next morning. (so much for no seats until 8 PM) When we arrived at the airport that flight had been canceled also. I didn't hear the reason as we were scrambling to get a car to drive up. When we got there our luggage was waiting for us as evidenced by the computer showing it there and the agent being able to deliver it to us and confirm delivery on her computer. Unknown to us, they canceled our return flights the next day. Probably because we never made the second leg of our itinerary. They obviously knew we made it there because we picked up our luggage. I suppose their computers aren't capable of talking to each other. I didn't find out our reservations had been canceled until a week later when I tried to check in and they couldn't find us. I called their help desk and was told the flight from DFW to BOI was fully booked, then after further research they restored all our reservation except for our seats. When I logged in to chose our seats I found quite a few available on both flights, the only downside was that I had to pay an extra $170 because these were considered premium seats, even though two were center seats. Bottom line, avoid American Airlines if at all possible. They have the worst customer service and their integrity is lacking when they cancel you for weather issues and fly about an hour later with other passengers.",Detractor
"  Charleston to Hancock via Chicago. United assumed operations to my hometown from Delta a few years ago and the service has become garbage. Almost every flight I've been on has been delayed or canceled. Every time I fly there it's a toss up whether or not I make it and chances are good I won't make it back to work on time. If given the option, take a different airline. In addition to their inability to manage the flight leg, their planes have uncomfortable seats and are usually too hot. If anybody from United reads this, you should go talk with a Delta rep and learn from them. Service wasn't this terrible when they managed the flight.",Detractor
" Geneva to Birmingham, For a low-cost airline (given their reputation), this experience was alright. They allowed a great deal of luggage weight, for a price mind. They even offered us the chance to put our wheeled hand luggage items (of which there were many) in the hold, which was a nice touch. An even better touch was offering FREE in-flight WiFi on the return flight, although that limits you to their own website in partnership with Rakuten, so I wouldn't bother with doing anything else. Overall, this was one of the better low-cost airlines I've flown, really great value for money.",Promoter
"I was legitimately quite concerned flying AC-Rouge from OGG-YVR on an overnight flight this past February. Reviews of dirty planes incompetence and no seat room had me lamenting my end of my vacation (more so) than usual. I am 6""4 most planes have a lack of room for someone of my height. I had built Rouge to be this awful thing after all it's transport how bad could it be. Honestly it wasn't horrid. Granted I had this flight through points I would be furious if it was purchased full fare for business. But as a leisure airline overnight where most passengers are sleeping it did the trick. I did not have a premium seat or exit row. Yes it was tight but I fit in there ok seems to be a theme most flights I'm on have little to no leg room this felt no worse. The entertainment system was moot as it was overnight. Cabin was quiet well served (yes those outfits are idiotic) and I think they know it too.

LAX-NRT-LAX (en-route to BKK) BizFirst on UA's new 787. Service both directions was really top notch. The crew were professional and attentive and on both legs the International Service Co-ordinator came to personally thank each passenger for their business and for choosing United (I thought that added a very nice touch). Meals were actually quite good and the wine parings worked well. Opted for the Japanese meal on the return and found it pleasantly delicious (including the array of sushi appetizers). The best thing about the trip was the aircraft. Arrived refreshed and didn't feel like I'd spent 12 hours in an airplane upon landing. Would recommend flying the a/c wherever possible.

"London Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid return. We did not have a good experience with Air Europa. Some of the problems we experienced included long delays at Madrid, with no good communication between the airline and the customers. Cabin crew in general not attentive. You have to pay 3 euros for head phones, the plane we flew (from Madrid to Guarulhos, 11 hours flight) had no individual screens for the in flight entertainment options. Despite requesting a gluten-free meal, I was only given the gluten-free option on the return flight. In general, customer service was not very good.

"  Lisbon to London Heathrow. TAP's policy for hand luggage is a tiny bag and less than 8KG. On the return trip I made sure to have less than 8KG, but they still took my bag away from me because of size. I was watching other passengers and many of them had their bags removed on both legs of my journey. Everyone was getting angry, but the staff didn't seem to really care. Leg room is really poor on this particular plane and you're kind of squashed in like sardines. They also have a bizarre boarding system of groups of A, B and C and for some reason they boarded people in the back rows last, so there was the inevitable long queue of people in the plane waiting for others in front of them. So it took ages to board. I will never fly TAP again.",Detractor
My wife and I flew Air Canada Rouge from Manchester to Chicago. We didn't know when we booked it that it was a Rouge flight. I will never fly with them again until they sort the leg room.

"  We chose Emirates to fly Manila to Boston and then back to Manila from JFK International. Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin's seat cannot be reclined, so we weren't able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It's a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what's happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just ""in a few minutes"". What the heck, you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila.

" My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didn't know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didn't know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. That's when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (that's four if you're counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and that's when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause he's allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. I'm not the only allergy sufferer and you'll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet. I followed the airlines rules and look where it got me, the run around, and a trip to urgent care for a sinus infection. Oh yeah, crazy small seats, no WiFi, piss poor customer service!

LAX to JFK via connecting flight in SFO. Seats were okay flight was noisy all but the few passengers in first class are forced to use two bathrooms in the back which made for long waiting times and lots of people going up and down aisles. A lot of effort into having a trendy ambience but not attentive to efficiency and actual customer service. Upon boarding the leg from LAX to SFO we were notified that the cabin was full and they would need to start gate checking carry-on bags. However instead of bringing the gate checked bags back to the gate on arrival they sent them to the baggage carousel at SFO. Normally this would just be a detour and inconvenience but in this case I only had 20 minutes until my connecting flight boarded. A security guard told me my bag should've been checked to my final destination - if I had not checked with the airline desk I would've flown to JFK only to find my bag had been left in SFO. Overall this experience demonstrated poor organization and procedure with gate checking bags and poor customer service when problems arose. And on another note other airlines are already doing mobile device boarding passes to expedite checking in - not sure why Virgin doesn't do this when it otherwise tries to have a trendy and modern image of its airline.,Detractor

They cater for all advance food orders first. Anyone who does not have an advance order cannot get more than a glass of water for 2 hours into the flight. They go up and down the aisle, dispensing food and wine and soft drinks, but refuse to serve you if you did not book an advance meal.

" Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold.

The flight attendants were friendly and welcoming the airplane was large and seats were comfortable both inbound and outbound flights departed and arrived on time. Having checked in my bag online and printed my boarding pass before I arrived at the airport made the experience effortless when no additional costs. I am so glad I decided to give Spirit a chance instead of listening to the negativity. Wonderful experience and now Spirit will be my plane of choice going forward.,Promoter
" Warsaw to Brussels on the new B737 Max 8. The flight was slightly delayed, but it wasn't a problem for me. Aircraft B737 Max 8 (SP-LVD) has high ceilings and was clean. Leg room was comparable to other major carriers. Service onboard was relatively poor (chocolate bar and water, tea, coffee), but it was only 2h flight. I would fly LOT again if any chance and I recommend it to other passengers.",Promoter
"  Kaunas to Luton with Wizz Air. Very pleased with the flight and cabin crew service. The 3 staff were professional, organised and made me feel very comfortable, especially when I wasn't feeling well. The plane was tidy and also the seats are comfortable.

" New York to Rome. I am an understanding guy, that believes you get what you pay for, there for going into this flight my expectations were not high but I had previously used Norwegian for an international flight which was great and that experience had probably increased my expectations. This trip I wouldn't call it horrible because I got from point A to point B and back with out any major issues. Price for my last minute trip was great 2-the staff seemed to be nice and helpful to those who required help. It is impossible to get anything done in their app it's pretty much useless, it doesn't let you check in, and it doesn't give you any updates on your flight. ( my flight changed gates at the lst minute). They used a secondary company for this leg called Privilege Styles (I didn't feel privileged at all). The plane had no entertainment system, they did have a screen in front of you which on 1 flight didn't work in any seat on my row, and on the other flight the remote control/phone thing was cut out of my seat. My seat didn't recline and the seat in front was reclined so that was a bad combination. The bathroom had visibly missing pieces but they worked, I generally don't want to see missing pieces on my airplane, one of them also had a big out of service sign.",Detractor
"Terrible customer service. I flew from Barcelona to London Gatwick. When I arrived at the gate, we were told that the flight was delayed and we would receive an update in an hour. Two and a half hours later, we still hadn't received an update and staff were nowhere to be seen. The flight set off over 3 hours late and no complimentary refreshments were provided. I logged a complaint on my return for which I received a substandard response not even acknowledging the points I raised. All subsequent emails have since been ignored. That was my first trip with Vueling and definitely my last.",Detractor
Travelling with ANA on the route of SGN-NRT-SGN. The flight to Narita was on time but the return trip was delayed due to passenger issue but it was acceptable since ANA's crew kept apologizing and dealt it professionally. The aircraft was a bit old. Inflight entertainment was good. Food was excellent and so was cabin crew. I would give it a 10 out of 10 if the seat were a bit wider.,Promoter
"For the most part, the experience was average. Except, there were a few specific instances in which I was extremely frustrated. 1) There was a delay in our flight (this happens), so we landed as soon as our connecting flight was finishing boarding. We stepped off the first plane (from Las Vegas to Austin), ran to the next gate for the next flight (Austin to DC), and as we arrived they were saying our names over the loudspeaker. We got on the flight and the plane was completely full except for our seats which was fine, however the flight attendants were not very kind, and we all felt that we were blamed for being late. However we have zero control in the matter of the other plane making it to the airport in time for the connecting flight. That was very unsettling, and embarrassing, as this was taking place in front of other passengers. 2) I attempted to connect to the WiFi via Southwest for their entertainment. This is free (yet limited) and there was no warning about that. The connection was also poor, so I decided to spend the $8 on the full-access WiFi. It took me over an hour to connect to this, and I needed certain applications on my phone to watch certain shows which I could set-up until after the flight. Again, there was no warning prior to purchasing that additional applications would be needed. Additionally, the connection was poor and I had to constantly refresh (even after paying), which was extremely frustrating. Generally, very limited legroom, and too long of a time getting snacks/refreshments, but I guess you get what you pay for.",Detractor
"Las Vegas to Lambert St Louis. My experience with Frontier was displeasing from the moment I started my check in process. The machine my boyfriend and I checked in on told us that we would have to pay $16 per seat in order to get seats next to each other so we paid $32 total to sit together. We were traveling with two friends who decided not to pay $16 and be assigned random seats. However, they were seated right next to each other anyways. So we paid $32 for something that our friends got for free. The next screen told us that we would be charged $30 for each checked bag (which we expected) and $40 for each carry-on bag - $40 for a carry on. I have never flown on an airline where I am charged for a carry on bag and certainly not one where it is more expensive to carry a bag on than check one. After we paid for this I went to the counter to ask the employee if all of those charges were valid. Not only was she unsure of the cost of a carry on bag but she was trying very hard to avoid all of my questions and check my bag and get me out of the line. She then told me that I could have just combined my purse and my backpack to make one personal item and I could have avoided the carry on fee all together. So I said OK and asked her to refund me for the $40 I had just paid for the carry on, to which she replied that she couldn't do refunds and gave me an 800 number to call. She told me to call before I boarded my flight and that she was making a note in my reservation. I called the number and chose the ""baggage"" option which routed me to an office that closes at 4 and immediately hung up on me as I was calling at 4:15. I called another number that was on the sheet and they informed me that the office never closes and I needed to just keep calling. (Ridiculous). I called again and just chose a random option so that I could be routed to a representative. This representative told me that I could not call about this before my flight and that I would have to call the next day, directly contradicting the employee at the airport. So I called again today and got another representative who said that they would not be able to offer me a refund as the employee at the airport did not make a note in my reservation. I told him that the employee specifically told me that she was making a note on my reservation. At this point he asked me for my call-back number in case my call got disconnected and then put me on hold for 10 minutes to ""check my reservation"". Finally he came back and said that he would process my $40 refund which is about the only good thing that came out of the whole situation. Not only was I infuriated at all of the extra charges but the flight was extremely turbulent and the lights on the plane kept turning on and off which is very frightening and not once did the flight attendants or the pilot make any kind of reassuring announcements to inform us of the situation other than to ""ensure we had our seat belts on"". There was no explanation. I did however get a good laugh when we started to descend as the flight attendant said over the intercom ""please make sure you seats are in an upright and locked position"" because our seats didn't even have an option to recline. I do understand that Frontier offers cheaper flights and that is the sole reason why my friends and I decided to book this flight. However, we ended up paying about as much as any other airline after all the baggage fees and seating fees that are charged when you check in. I will not fly Frontier again.",Detractor
20/6/14 EK88 ZRH-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Pretty new aircraft of 1.3 years old. 85% Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. This time drinks came with salted biscuits 40m after take off. Dinner service 2h30m after take off and drinks came 30m later. This left many passengers parched and kept asking crew for drinks which they weren't very happy to oblige on this leg. There was no menu as well not sure if crew forgot or there was insufficient. Dinner was really good with choices between salmon with saffron risotto and grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I had the latter. Chicken breast a little dry but went well with the sauce. My mother had the salmon and the risotto was really delicious. Dessert of lemon torte was really good and I could have had multiple servings. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Staff service was terrible on this flight the worst flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Hardly any smiles during service which honestly does not matter call buttons by other passengers went unanswered. No drinks service after the meal service. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. I asked for 2 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and a rude male crew told me to get back to my seat and ask for it later. Not recommended this time. On a positive note a family of passengers who ordered Indian vegetarian meals didn't have their meals loaded and a female cabin crew were extremely helpful even going to business class to get a sandwich for them.,Passive

While waiting an hour on the plane in Harare the mass cleaning crew come on board you can't use the toilets no drinks are served you feel like you're in the way as you lift your legs for the vacuum cleaner. Emirates also fly the Lusaka / Harare route but at least have the consideration to stop in Lusaka then Harare so the plane is empty for cleaning before setting off again.

Last month I flew FRA-Malta-FRA. With the exception of one seemingly bored and unfriendly flight attendant both crews were highly professional obviously well trained attentive and friendly. Both flights on time the cabins spotless. Good Service as usual especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo a really bad presentation. Such a pity that this reliable airline one of the very best in my opinion is failing again and again with the snacks and food which is offered. Very good ticket rate booked early in advance.,Promoter

"Red eye flight from Vancouver to Toronto was on time. As I was aware that Air Canada's Y-class on this particular aircraft and route is extremely cramped, I booked a ""preferred seat"" at the front. This cost an extra 60 CAD but was more than worth it: These seats are used as ""premium economy"" seats on international flights on this particular B777. Legroom was more than sufficient, as was the seat width. Catering is not complementary, and can only be purchased via credit card - no cash. I don't think that is a good policy as not all credit cards are accepted by Air Canada, at least mine wasn't (my Hotel did, as did the grocer beside the Hotel...). But it is possible to book a meal online ahead of your flight which I did on my way back. This worked just fine and I recommend this service as you pay less than on the aircraft. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Recommended (but don't forget to book that ""preferred seat""!).",Promoter
" I previously had absolutely awful experiences with Aeromexico, but did not learn the lesson and booked a trip with them again. Once again I faced delayed flights and incompetent, ignorant service. My flight from Mexico City to Oaxaca was delayed for more than an hour, but the information in the Aeromexico terminal was displayed as ""On Time"" with no gate number and no sensible informatiom from staff who I approached at least four times. Finally I was directed to the Aeromexico counter and sent to the gate where we were kept waiting long past ""on time"" departure time. But it was fine as Oaxaca was my final destination. On my way back though I had only 1.5 hours in Mexico City between flights, and the flight from Oaxaca-Mexico City was delayed for an hour. In Oaxaca I was told by an agent at the counter that I would have to go through security in Mexico City, therefore could not buy Mezcal in Oaxaca as I only had a carry on bag. Since I lost an hour of transfer time, I lost all hope of making my flight to New York, but in Mexico City I did not have to go through security and ran to make it to the departure gate. However, this success was spoiled when I was refused an aisle seat as ""that was a full flight"". In the cabin, though there was an aisle seat which I was able to take with permission from the crew, and it was not the only available one. How inhuman it was to not accommodate my request at the counter! I only hope I will never have to fly with Aeromexico again.",Detractor

No idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled ""chicken or beef"" response when asked stewardess. Old and tatty plane very small TVs.

YVR-LHR-AMS. An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.,Passive

In general the standards are rising, but I don't understand why they still do not offer ice for soft drink. During the trip, FAs show me how well they train.

"Las Vegas to London Heathrow via LAX, and I initially booked this fight with a 2 hour changeover in LAX. I had concerns when received an email from American Airlines advising of 45 minute changeover, I sent several emails advising of concern, their response was to request I call them in USA. I find it strange that a company that you are paying good money to, contacts you by one option but then you have to contact them by another, I feel this needs to be addressed, I never in the end used the phone as I have had to do this with other airlines wasting time and money and just hoped all would work out. Checked in at Las vegas 3 hours before flight and was told there was no Business Lounge for American Airlines, strange as their main competitor has one and there are other lounges which you can pay to go into, why does AA not do this? The internal flight to LAX was ok, plenty of legroom in Business seats with some recline, we were provided with a bag of chips and a drink. Changeover at LAX was very efficient, arrived at gate next to where we had to get our plane to LHR, arrived with 10 minutes until boarding started. Boarded plane with no greeting from cabin staff they seemed to be engaged in conversation with each other, this caused issues when seating as my wife had to go all the way back to the front. Seat was a great set up, same as Cathay Pacific. Good seat storage, good choice of movies on large screen and comfortable seat and bed, although those over 6 foot might find ther feet feel restricted with limited foot space when in lie flat mode. Cabin staff were efficient and professional although they were not vey welcoming and did not smile - I managed after many contacts to get a smile from a hostess, but it seems to me that most do not want to be doing this job? It is strange that American Airlines would not choose to focus more on customer service especially as this is their new flagship plane. Suitcaes arrived at detination which was good. Overall experience was reasonable with food and seating being the best part of the experience.",Passive
QF9 outbound MEL-LHR on 3 June and QF2 inbound LHR to SYD on 13 June both with stops in DXB. Most of my mainline trips to London Dubai Singapore and HK are on Qantas craft. Despite all the criticism I have to say that Qantas on the mainline routes have upped their game. Excellent service from FA's. Meals can be a little inconsistent but have generally found this when the catering is resourced from London in particular. As a comparison my wife travelled out earlier on Emirates also on their A380 service. Same metal but more cramped and an inconsistent level of service from the FA's. No real negatives on either of QF2/9 save the usual gripe about the wait to disembark the A380 which applies to all.,Promoter
"easyJet is not a cheap airline if you don't book when the ""headline"" fares go on sale or when they run one of their fare sales. Because it was an early morning flight we had to book a hotel nearby. The one plus is being able to check in your bag the night before to save time in the morning. The staff doing that told us to hurry as she was about to go off shift and we would have had to wait for her replacement to arrive! Next morning we did just breeze through however. We were in the South terminal. What a horrible terminal. The only upside was we had a gate were we actually boarded using a plane bridge instead of the stairs! Onboard the crew were very nice and the plane clean and tidy. I find their on board menu options overpriced and they never seem to have the items I want anyway! The flight to Paphos is over 4 hours and easyJet seats don't recline (even though they tell you make sure your seat is in the upright position) and there is no head rest support. easyJet planes are like sitting on a park bench. Nice for a little while, but eventually you want to move on. But you can't. The whole plane got fidgety because they were so uncomfortable. These no frills flights are fine for short trips but for mid haul like this they really need to have more comfort features built in to their seats etc. I wouldn't contemplate them for flights over 2 hours unless there was no full service airline available.",Detractor

"  Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn't be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip.

"The cabin crew were disinterested and slow. They act and like they are doing a special favour for you by pouring you a drink or even getting you some napkins. Blankets and headsets weren't offered but sold to you. You either bring your own (which takes up space), buy theirs, or freeze without being able to hear the movie. Comfort levels will decrease and the flight attendants won't be able to help much. A flight attendant told me that they cannot help me lift my luggage into the high luggage compartment. Any person complaining about any slight discomfort with reason were rudely put on the spot (the lights were broken and couldn't be turned off for one of the passengers so the passenger had to ask about it or else he couldn't nap. The flight attendant only tried their minimum best to help by taping the lights and then left him alone. The taped lights continued to fall off but the flight attendants just ignored him and responded only if the passenger actively tried to complain again. The flight attendant just tossed my napkins down on the table and left without a reply. I found it quite rude and impolite. The seats were new but poorly designed. The buttons for the remote were built onto the armrest of the passengers. It looks simple and basic but it was terribly uncomfortable for the passengers. Thus, many times the service button was accidentally pressed causing the flight attendants to become annoyed at us even though it was an accident. The lights, service, or volume buttons would accidentally turn on whenever I try to rest my arms on the armrest. A suggestion may be to add a cover for the buttons so that these small inconveniences can be avoided in the future.

" Amsterdam to Madrid. I could have flown with KLM for the same money but I decided to fly Air Europa for the first time because a Boeing 787 would be operating the flight. Always nice to fly a wide body aircraft on a short European route! I checked in 40 hours before departure with their IOS app. The app is very basic because there was no way to select a seat. I was asked if I wanted to pay more for a seat with more legroom and after selecting no, I was randomly allocated to a middle seat without the option to choose an isle or window seat. After the boarding pass was loaded in my wallet I was shocked because my name was misspelled. My surname was shown twice, while my name was correctly spelled on the reservation. To avoid being denied boarding I called their service center on Saturday. After waiting for 50 minutes on the line, I explained the problem to an agent and first he tried to let me pay 18 Euros for changing my name. I didn't agree because my name was correctly spelled on the reservation so something must have gone wrong from their side. After a lot of noise from his keyboard he told me it was OK and my name would be correct on the boarding pass. Not a great first impression! The flight itself was on time. At the airport I was able to change my seat to a window seat and add my Flying Blue number because it was mysteriously gone from the booking as well although I entered my frequent flyer number during the booking process. The aircraft (EC-MLT) didn't look in a good shape for a 2 year young aircraft. Filthy carpets, filthy seats and a grey/brown sludge coming from the air vents on the side and overhead panels. The entertainment system however is good and legroom is sufficient. On board everything is for sale just like a low-cost carrier. Not that I expect a meal or a sandwich on a 2 hour flight but a water or coffee would be appreciated. They advertise as a full service SkyTeam airline, but they are just another low-cost carrier. The flight landed on time at Madrid an after a long taxi ride we arrived at terminal 1. The jet-bridge was connected and shortly afterwards the jet-bridge retracted again, because this was an intra EU-flight and terminal 1 is only for non EU-flights. Airstairs arrived and we were bussed to the Schengen arrival area of terminal 2. I had my trolley checked in and waited at belt for the luggage to arrive. Only the priority luggage arrived and after 30 minutes the system said that all luggage was being loaded at the belt, while there were at least 100 passengers waiting for their luggage to arrive. Air Europa staff said 10 minutes, 10 minutes but nothing happened. It seemed they didn't care and there was confusion because suddenly luggage from another flight popped up on the belt and the Amsterdam flight disappeared from the screens. Finally 90 minutes after landing the luggage arrived. I think the luggage was transported to terminal 1 (where the aircraft arrived) instead of terminal 2. 90 minutes waiting for your luggage to arrive is insane. While the flight itself was fairly OK Air Europa needs to improve a lot of things to make it comfortable for passengers to fly with them.",Detractor

Food service was well presented with a good selection of drinks. The lie flat beds and duvet made for a good night's sleep with the option of pyjamas for extra comfort. The amenity kits are of excellent quality and the IFE system reliable with a good selection of films and music. Both the outbound and inbound flights suffered a short delay on takeoff but the time was made up during the flights. EVA Air use the Air Canada Lounge at T2 at Heathrow which offers a comfortable environment with a fair selection of food, while the newly revamped EVA Air Lounge at Bangkok offers a large comfortable lounge, good selection of food with Internet and showers. Costwise EVA Air offer a very competitive price compared with other airlines on the route with the added advantage of it being non-stop.",Promoter
" Everything went well until a technical issue. The plane had pushed back, then started to taxiing but after about 30-40 meters it just stopped. We saw some cars around the aircraft and later on the crew announced a technical issue. It was about hydraulics. But the all the announcements were only in Italian, what is quite strange, especially on an international flight. I have never experienced that even on internal flights. Cabin crew should not be that lazy. Anyway, afterwards our 1 extra hour in the plane everything was good and we arrived back to Barcelona with a smooth flight.",Detractor
"  Flew on Air India from New Delhi to Lucknow. I was transferring from Lufthansa to Air India, so checked-in my bag at the designated counter for connecting passengers. When I presented my Air India boarding pass and check-in bag (which was already tagged from L.A. to Lucknow), they told me that I would have to go upstairs to the main check-in area. I insisted that they process me at the designated counter for connecting passengers, or else it beats the purpose for having one in the first place! Overall, I wasn't impressed with the ground staff's professionalism. The on-board experience was okay. I wished the Flight Attendant ""Good Morning"" while entering the aircraft, she responded ""Namaskar"". It was a short 1 hour flight with express snack service. There was no IFE or WiFi on-board. If you are travelling with a baby or sitting in an exit row, the flight attendant will ask you if you prefer instructions in English or Hindi.",Passive
" Palma to San Sebastian via Barcelona. After having a flight that was delayed for almost 2 hours due to missing flight crew, our flight was then rerouted to an alternate destination within about an hours drive of our original destination due to ""low clouds"". Upon arriving the the alternate destination, I was without luggage. I filed a claim at the airport and took a taxi to the original flight destination for an additional cost of approximately 100 Euros. I arrived to clear skies and no sight of ""low clouds"". Over 24 hours later, my luggage was located and delivered to my hotel. After filing a luggage claim reimbursement online, several weeks later I was instructed to submit all supporting documentation and send it through the postal service via certified mail. I did so at a cost of $16.65. Another several weeks later, my claim was denied because Vueling stated my baggage was delivered within 24 hours. It was not. So, I added international calling to my mobile plan, in order to call customer service in Spain from the US. This just cost me another $5.00, only to be told by ""Luggage Incidents"" that my baggage was delivered within 24 hours, but they cannot tell me what time it was actually delivered. I asked to speak with a manager and was denied. The is the absolute worst customer service I have ever received from an airline, and I will not fly Vueling ever again. A train would have been a better option and we would have arrived at our intended destination quicker and with my luggage in hand.",Detractor
"Seattle to Maztalan via Los Angeles. Flight to Maztalan was delayed 1.5 hours due to having de ice plane. Made it to LAX and the connecting flight to Maztalan was held for 53 people on Seattle flight. Pretty decent flight and then that evening I got a note promising a certificate of $75 off a future flight in a few days - that was 6th December, now its the 22 December and zip. Had a great time in Mexico, then the flight out of Mexico was delayed for no reason. We were able to upgrade to exit row#6. One thing I have noticed with carry on is some people that board first to the back rows are putting their carry ons in first overhead bins, I assume to avoid dragging their luggage up row while exiting - but then no room in overhead bins for people in rows behind first class. We landed in LA, sat on plane for 45 minutes while exit door was worked on only to be told we would be exiting from back of plane. OMG the people in back rows that put their bags up front now had to work their way up front to get their bags! No wonder people go insane.

13 hours 20 minutes flight from LAX to Seoul South Korea. We made seat reservation for two of us including my 3 year old son.

" I had a terrible experience trying to get on my flight. Staff were useless and gave me wrong the information and were telling me I couldn't get on my flight because they couldn't print my boarding pass, despite confirming that I was checked in on the flight and the flight hadn't even started boarding yet. They sent me to flight reservations to book another flight because they couldn't print a boarding pass. I sensed this was ridiculous and went to another check in desk and they printed it for me then and there immediately. I had lost about 40 minutes hitting brick walls with Aer Lingus staff and the Aer Lingus app and trying to get up to security and back down to check in. It meant I had to run through security and for about 10 minutes to the far end of the terminal to make my flight. I was soaked in sweat and really uncomfortable getting on the flight. It was an example of a catalogue of bad processes and negligent don't care attitude staff. I checked in online and took a screenshot of my boarding pass. I went to the airport for about 1 hour before boarding and tried to print my boarding pass at the terminal. It wouldn't allow me. I went to the Aer Lingus concierge and she said it was odd but the screen shot I have will do. Security couldn't accept the screenshot because it wouldn't scan. I downloaded the Aer Lingus app but it wouldn't give me my boarding pass. I went back to the check in desk and they wandered off to check something and came back to tell me they can't print boarding passes because it's within 45 minutes of the flight. This was incorrect and I finally got someone who knew what they were doing.",Detractor

New seats have top notch entertainment system and a foot bag underneath the seat in front of you which I found brilliant. Crew was very warm and accommodating I went into the galley mid-flight for a snack and the FA heated a muffin up for me in the oven. I found the new meal service without the trays refreshing. 3 healthy choices for both breakfast and dinner I for instance had an excellent duck noodle salad. 5 different wines on offer! Only downside I found was the outrageous 25 AUD$ charge for seat selection. But will absolutely fly them again when in the region.,Promoter
"  Minneapolis to Phoenix. Our $394 ticket became $534. I don't object to their Ryanair-type methods. I've flown Ryanair in Europe, no problem. $3 for a soda? Could care less. $2 for crackers? So what? Window seat charge? What I object to is, despite their claims, they are not transparent and upfront. For example, their $9 membership, isn't $9, it's $59. At the end of the arduous online experience when you're trying to book your ticket (and after shutting down that $9 club window numerous times), you receive a summary of costs and you must pay it now. There's no option to say ""no"" don't need or want this or that, and then pay. So, for example, most online sites when providing a summary before payment, let you correct any errors. Not Spirit Airlines. You need to go back to the beginning and start all over again. Their marketing gimmick of sending panic notices 2 days before your fight is well-crafted psycho drama. Reserve your seat now or it will cost $100 at the airport! Well, guess what? You don't have to reserve a seat. Guess what, you don't have to pay for one carry-on that sits beneath the seat in front of you. But you just did. This is not about knowing the ropes.

Flight UA3789 August 27 2014. Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!,Detractor
June 4 2014 Newark to Copenhagen and June 18 2014 Copenhagen to Newark. My wife and I chose SAS because we were travelling to Denmark and believed Scandinavians would provide the finest 1st class travel experience. It was our first vacation in 31 years. The 2 transatlantic flights cost us $6756. We researched the airline extensively. The planes we were on were at least 15-20 years old. The gourmet meals shown on their website was actually a microwaved tiny meal the overstocked snack buffet they advertised was a few bags of chips a few cans of soda and 2 bottles of wine. Even the very polite crew couldn't make up for this. Plus it was the same on both flights! Never again will we fly SAS.,Detractor
"  Flying with Spirit has been a total nightmare from the start. We were leaving Plattsburgh to Fort Lauderdale. Never made it to Fort Lauderdale because of fog (I totally understand this is none of their fault). We landed in Orlando, but didn't get any explanation of why. We had to wait for 2 hours at the Spirit counter before being instructed there would be bus accomodation to bring us to Fort Lauderdale. After waiting another 2h, we've been told that only 55 people could get on that bus and another one might arrive about an hour later. We decided to rent a car at our own charge since we were in Fort Lauderdale only for a couple days and couldn't afford to lose more time. When we left Fort Lauderdale, the flight attendant announced the flight was overbooked and they were asking for volunteers to catch a flight later. We have been offered a total of 4 free round-trip vouchers to anywhere Spirit flies. The flight attendant at the counter told us (and we signed for!) flights within US would be totally free and for flights outside US, we would only have to pay for airport tax. We decided to volunteer but when the time came to use those vouchers I spent hours on the phone with the company to find an available flight (we had multiple choices and flexible for the dates) and we were told that finally only bare fares were covered by the vouchers and even in US we would have to pay for all the other charges. We will never use Spirit again since it definitely doesn't worth saving a few bucks for that kind of headache!",Detractor
"I've been flying with easyJet since the very beginning, so I have a particular affection for the company. However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them. Overall I do like easyJet but their boarding procedures are becoming inconsistent and a tad shambolic.",Passive
LHR-AUH-SYD return. Just returned from a trip to Australia. The chauffeur pick up worked well and the lounge at T4 was very good. Staff very attentive. On A340 on both outbound legs and food and wine of good quality. On the way out visited the crowded lounge in Abu Dhabi but managed to have a shower and the staff helped find me a place to sit. Inbound first leg on code share Virgin Australia. Etihad seats far superior as every seat has an aisle access. On the Virgin flight (777) I had a window seat and had to climb over the passenger next to me when he was sleeping. Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one. Food and wine again good on return legs. My only criticism is that the entertainment on offer is nowhere near what it is on Emirates or Qantas.,Promoter

First be aware, that if you are using a browser that is not Internet explorer it does not work. Firefox does not work. If you try to access their online chat, it comes back they are too busy. There is no wait line. If you try to call it is a good 30 minute wait, at least. To save money the airline has clearly cut back on essential website design, and staffing needed to help customers. In fact there is no phone number even listed on their website that I could locate. Folks we are talking about a seriously deficient airline, unable and unwilling to assist customers. They do this, even though they charge extra for helping! So even making money charging for help, they cant be bothered. Pathetic beyond belief.",Detractor

ARN-TFS-ARN with Norwegian. Booked it because of the cheap fare (if booked in advance) - we were a group of five and the flexibility of not having to limit to the usual package holiday 7 or 14 days. Both flights were delayed by about one hour. On the way out had managed to reserve Exit row seating which had great legroom even if a bit narrow.

Traveled to Las Vegas last week on Rouge for the 1st and last time. I am 6' tall and do not fit in the seat as my knees were pushing into the back of the passenger ahead of me. This passenger seated in the seat ahead of me was upset at the fact my knees were in her back but after getting up and looking at my predicament was understanding of the situation. The flight I was on was full of people partying. Instead of trying to subdue the rowdiness the Rouge flight attendants were joining the party. I finally looked at the attendant and asked her to keep her voice down and it would be nice if she would ask the other passengers to do the same. She looked at me as if I was doing something wrong. I was sitting on the aisle my companion next to me in the middle and a young man in the window seat who never actually sat in his seat but instead on the arm rest facing us with his feet on the seat and yelling loudly to all his friends sitting around us. The Rouge staff never once asked him to calm down and actually were laughing and joking with him and his friends. FYI this was a night flight which normally would have been a flight where catching a nap for a few hours would have been normal. It was so loud I could not hear the movie I was watching with my head phones. In future I will never fly Rouge again.

So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.,Promoter
My husband and I had a flight last week back to Houston TX from LA. We were about to leave for the airport when my husband got a notification not from spirit airlines that our flight was delayed. When we were on our way to the airport for the second time he decided to check again to see what our flight status was and it was cancelled. We did not receive an email from spirit indicating that our flight was cancelled. By far the worst airline! This was the first time we have taken this airline and will be the last time we do so. The flight tickets maybe cheap but it is not worth it in the end.,Detractor
"Two flights to get us from Ankara to Athens. The first leg was to Istanbul. Online check-in worked and very fast service at Ankara airport. Boarding started 50 minutes before flight due to go which seemed early. Flight was supposed to be 45 minutes, revised to 52, and eventually took 80 as we went past Istanbul and then turned back. This left us with tight connection at AtatÃ¼rk. However we left half an hour late for no apparent reason. So overall too much time on the planes for such a short journey. Onboard service excellent though. In flight entertainment not turned on for first flight, but was for second.",Passive
"  Frankfurt to Lisbon. Ryanair is a great airline. I have flown with many US airlines (Delta, American) and they were great. But Ryanair is just great. This flight was about 15 euros! I went to Lisbon and came back about a week ago. The food was 5 euros and it was a sandwich, and it was actually good. A Pepsi was about 2 euros. We landed. It was a good landing too. And we parked at a gate and not at a stand which was great. Only concern that happened is I waited about 1 hour and 20 mins to get to the plane. One delay because of rain in France, then the bus didn't start moving after 20 minutes! Then we stood in the bus right by the plane for 10 minutes. It was in the middle of nowhere but I highly recommend it.",Promoter
"  On June 12 my husband and I were supposed to be on the flight from Hong Kong to Honolulu via Beijing. We had a booked and planned two-week vacation in Hawaii with interisland flights between three Hawai'i islands and booked hotels. At noon, on June 12 we got a phone call from the agent, CTrip, through which we booked our return flight to HNL to tell us that Air China cancelled our flight that evening. Since it was the carrier Air China who cancelled the flight. CTrip could not rebook us on any other flight to HNL even though we explained that we have a hotel reseravtions and rentacar paid for for two week vacation as well as interisland flights and that they are costing us thousands of dollars by this impromptu decision. They were not able to offer anything to us. Neither a rebooking later that evening nor change of air carrier within the Star Allaince. We went to the HKG airport just to receive the same information from Air China ground staff, who were rude, unapproachable, insolent to say the least. The ground staff just gave a terse answer that all Air China flights leaving HKG that day were cancelled due to typhoon, even though all other companies were departing that night, with a bit of dalay but they weren't cancelled, without offering a solution, customer care or showing any compassion and cooperation. The only thing that we got was the refund for the tickets in full and only becuase we had booked throught an agent. At the end, we managed to find a flight that would take us out of HKG to HNL, Korean Air. The plane departed that evening with two hrs delay without a fear of typhoon or endangering its passangers.",Detractor

"I flew business class. The seat was uncomfortable, but the worst thing happened on the ground. In both cases, I had to layover in Shanghai for 24 hours. The first time, they said it was my mistake. The second time, the plane was late, and the fellow pushing my wheelchair told my Chinese traveling companion that the plain would be delayed until 4 pm and then left us in a crowded, noisy, uncomfortable waiting room. The staff said they were going to give the passengers lunch - although I couldn't see how that would be possible. We went upstairs, fortunately there was an escalator there, ate and came back to find nowhere to sit, and no new information. We went back upstairs, and 30 minutes later were approached by a young man with a wheelchair. He did not speak English, but informed my companion the plane had left without us. Finally, they gave us a ticket to Bangkok and I had to pay for a hotel and he flights to Chiang Mai - about $400. Through it all the ground staff was rude, inconsiderate and unresponsive.",Detractor
" Oslo to Toronto via Reykjavik. Flight over to Copenhagen went well, assistance for my sister as requested, although all luggage lost and not received until the next day. Return trip started going sideways in Reykjavik. Plane was scheduled to depart at 5:05, sat waiting for a connection flight and didn't leave for 35 minutes. Toronto, a disaster--one bus sent for all passengers to go to terminal 3. The doors of the terminal wouldn't open for people to get on the bus. Finally another bus came, I got to terminal 3 and waited 1.5 hours for our luggage to arrive and thus missed our connecting flight to Regina. We had to spent the night in the airport, get in line at 4:30 am to rebuy tickets to get home. I contacted their customer service and they said they were not responsible as we were using another carrier to get to Regina. I pointed out they do not service Regina and had they left on time, and got us to the terminal and sent our luggage over in an efficient manner we wouldn't have missed our flight. We will not fly with this airline again, they are just not into solving the problems they create.",Detractor

London Gatwick to Mauritius 27th December return 7th January. 777 Aircraft economy class. I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines and still charging more. I have no idea why people use them.,Detractor
Very unfriendly ground staff at Vilnius airport. I booked my ticket and paid at Tallinn office no mention of hand baggage rules either from the employee or printed on my ticket. I checked in and was told me I could take my hand baggage as carry on. No problem at the gate no problem at transfer gate in Riga to Vilnius. But at Vilnius airport with same hand baggage on my way back to Helsinki via Riga I was harassed by a young lady until I paid 60 Euros to check in my hand baggage because it was 12 kg instead of 8.9 kg.

"  A few weeks ago I flew from Madrid to Louisville, stopping first in Dublin and then Chicago before arriving at my final destination. All of the segments of the ticket were on one ticket and the whole ticket was under Aer Lingus and the last segment was under Aer Lingus but operated by United. My wife and I flew together and we each checked a second bag. We paid the fee for the second bag in Madrid but our bags were not checked all the way through even though we had one ticket. In Chicago we picked up our bags and went to recheck them at the United gate and they told us that United had no relationship with Aer Lingus, and that as a result we would have to pay again. Basically they did not give us a choice, they said pay and go to the gate or go back to the international terminal and speak to Aer Lingus which would mean missing our flight. I canÂ´t believe what happened. The next day we called and spoke to someone with Aer Lingus, gave all our information and receipt numbers and no one ever contacted us. So we called again and and again. My wife spoke to at least 4 different agents. One told her that other was dealing with our case and then another who she spoke to after, had no idea. Finally after about 6 phone calls and hours wasted she was told to send our receipts to prove that we were charged by both United and Aer Lingus. WeÂ´ve sent all this information on August 5th an till this day no one has even contacted us.

Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles in Qantas Business class. This would have to rate as one of the worst travelling experiences we have had. It began at check-in to find our seat had been changed and while travelling as a couple we had been split up. When we pointed this out we were seated together but with bad grace. This was followed by disorganisation at the boarding gate in Melbourne where everyone was herded together with no attempt to have controlled lines. Having boarded we were advised of a delay with the reason given as refuelling being late. An attempt at humour was offered that perhaps the re-fuelers had overindulged at Christmas. Total inefficiency would have been a more accurate explanation. We arrived in LA late so transfer to New York flight was chaotic and delayed. Qantas staff at LAX gave the impression they had no idea as to how to handle the situation. To top this experience our luggage was lost and two days later has not been located. We were directed to British Airways luggage service at JFK and they have been hopeless. Luggage was not forwarded as promised that night and next morning as we were departing for Canada we went to the office again and they could not tell us where it was. The 1800 telephone number does not respond and we still do not have our luggage. We have tried to contact Qantas in Australia to be told via automated response there is a 63 minute hold time. This service from Qantas is disgraceful. An email sent to Qantas customer feedback resulted in an automated response indicated a 15 day wait. The seat in business class is fine but would be very hard without the addition of a quilt like mattress provided. The food certainly does not live up to the hype of a Neil Perry menu. The attitude of staff is perfunctory at best and the luggage staff at JFK were a disgrace. Unfortunately we are returning with Qantas as we would not choose to fly with them again but having incurred the enormous expense of new clothes suitable for the snow in Canada we are not wishing to add to the expense created by this poor service.,Detractor
" Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.",Detractor

 Las Vegas to Kansas City. This airline is terrible! We had the worst experience ever with them! Coming home from Vegas and went to check in for flight and find out they cancelled our flight. We waited an hour for them to start calling us up! When we got up there she told us we should have an email. They rerouted us through Delta and we had to fly to Atlanta and have a 3 hour lay over and then fly back to KC!

Today I called to find out when my refund was coming and they informed me they could not refund my money! That I should of gotten the refund while I was there!

This June was the first time I travelled with Air Europa from Buenos Aires to London and back. On The outward journey I was allowed and paid for extra baggage but on return this was not allowed not even if it had been a few kilos! However a couple travelling with a little boy were allowed to take 6 large suitcases (paying of course for the extra 3) is this fair? How can this be? Why wasn't I told that I could take it but not bring it back? What is the reason for such a ridiculous rule? The flight from Madrid to Buenos Aires had at least 25 empty seats two of which were next to me. In spite of the kind and friendly cabin crew this ruined my holiday.

"Flew from NYC to Rome toward the end of August, 2016. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, because the plane was warm and needed to be cooled down, which was supposed to take a ""few minutes"", but took over an hour to begin boarding. The on-plane service was good, the staff friendly and professional and the food was surprisingly very good. The plane was old, with no charging stations or personal entertainment system at individual seats (and I wouldn't call a hanging aisle TV, set at mute, playing some random old movies any kind of entertainment). However, what made the flight especially bad for me was the seat. I had an aisle seat, which I generally like, but the aisle armrest was of the type that couldn't be lifted and the entire flight its corner was constantly eating into my leg. It was 8+ hours of suffering, in a plane which was insufficiently cool. The flight cost just over $500 one way and I think that's a little too much for an old plane with uncomfortable seats and no technology whatsoever. For a no frills plane, the cost should have been no more than $400-450 one way, even during high season.",Detractor
First time using Icelandair and probably the last. Despite booking in January and choosing my seat in Comfort Class they were changed 5 times before I even traveled. I e-mailed a complaint to which I did have a reply. Flight to Reykjavik was okay minimal service and a very poor selection of food. Delay connecting with the London leg due to the go slow. 2 hours late for a 2.5 hour flight.! and they changed my seat. Terrible boarding procedure no announcements and no jetway so we had to walk up the steps which slowed everything even more. On the return leg via Reykjavik the Seattle flight was on the board as leaving on time although boarding did not commence until the take off time. Again no announcements and walking up the steps again. Plus they tried to change my seat and this time I refused. One pass of the drink and food cart for a 7.5 hour flight. They are really not service oriented. Why is there no jetway available for the Seattle in and out bound flight? and why are 3 US bound flights leaving at the same time from adjacent gates causing absolute chaos in a small waiting area?,Detractor
"  Phoenix to Colorado Springs. If you enjoy being nickle and dimed to death, this is the airline for you. You pay for everything beyond the right to sit in the most uncomfortable seat imaginable. Pre-selecting a seat, carry-on bag, checked bag, any kind of food or drink (except tap water) all require an extra fee. And God forbid you should decide to choose a seat or bring a bag after you book, you get the great privilege of paying extra. Strangely enough, at least for my flight, it was cheaper to check a bag than bring a carry-on bag.The closer you are to the plane, the more you pay. If you want one of the ""stretchy"" seats you pay $20 when you book, $25 after you book, and $50 once you're on the plane.

" Buenos Aires to San Francisco via Panama City. Garbage customer service. I am a gold Star Alliance member. Copa doesn't deserve to be in Star Alliance. The first leg of our return trip was delayed due to Copa's fault and we missed our connecting flight. Copa customer service didn't help in any way and offered no compensation. How Copa handled this situation was not professional or correct due to following multiple reasons: In Buenos Aires, Copa representatives assured us that despite the delayed flight, we could still catch our connecting flight in Panama and Copa reps would greet us as soon as we land in Panama in order to direct us to the connecting flight. No such thing happened. We saw no help from Copa in Panama to help us catch our flight. So the representatives in Buenos Aires wrongly informed us. We were again misinformed by Copa representatives this time in Panama while rebooking our missed flight. We were told there was no flight to San Francisco the next day (Monday) so we must wait and leave two days later (Tuesday). But as we learnt 10 minutes after receiving this information, another passenger traveling to San Francisco was rebooked on a flight on Monday because Copa accepted to fly her to Los Angeles first and got a United Airlines ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco. This passenger wasn't in business class. She told us she could get the flight the next day because she argued more and could speak Spanish. So we were lied and put in a disadvantaged position just because we didn't argue and politely accepted what Copa offered us. At the end we could get to San Francisco after a 40 hour delay. We both missed 2 days of work. Now I can't reach customer service via email or phone. The customer service email given to us is a black hole. My emails are only returned with an auto response.

Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight.

" Let me start by saying Spirit has absolutely the worst customer service of any airline I've ever flown with. I had a flight scheduled from Guatemala to Orlando with an arrival time to Orlando of 10.30pm. I arrived at the airport gate on time. No agents were on duty. Only to receive 12 email notifications that my flight was being delayed and then cancelled due to a mechanical issue with the plane. By the time they cancelled the flight I would have been arriving at my destination. 2.5 hours before my flight was cancelled, I called customer service to try and get an update because I had a connection to Hawaii and another to Australia. I explained to 7, yes 7 people who kept passing me around the same department, giving me no options that would allow me to make my connection, therefore causing me to miss my 2 additional flights in cost of over $2000. After 7 people I demanded to speak to a supervisor who only offered an apology and to talk to an agent at the gate. At this point I had been on the phone for 2 hours and no agents had been assigned to the gate and asked to speak to another supervisor. This gentleman was the worst of them all. He told me he would refund my cancelled flight. Then I explained by missing my connection it would cost me well over $2000 to rebook my next two flights last minute and it was not acceptable to me that due to an issue on the airliness part that their customer, would be penalized by thousands of dollars due to no fault of my own. He hung up on me. Finally agents showed up at the gate and apologized. Only offering to rebook my flight for the next day. If they had cancelled my flight earlier I could have gotten a different flight through another airline and not have missed my connection. The fact that me, their customer, was missing 2 very expressive connections, was not of any priority to anyone I spoke to and was advised to write an email to customer service. Needless to say I don't recommend Spirit at all, to anyone. Customers pay for a service and if a company cannot complete the service due to faulty machinery on their part, they should have accountability for the repercussions of their customers. I don't believe anyone on the flight that was cancelled will ever use Spirit again. Beyond ridiculous.",Detractor

So if you are expecting something much more fancy you will be disappointed. But for us the flight went just fine. Very punctual with all parts of the trip and very friendly staff at all ends.

" Beirut to Bangkok (Dubai layover) via FlyDubai. The flight attendants are friendly, at least most of them. The smell when entering the aircraft was unbearable, coming straight of the toilets, the AC was at minimum power, which left us suffocating inside the plane, and was not turned on properly until reaching cruising altitude. The seats are very tight, not comfortable at all, you can't lean forward to sleep, heck you can barely perform safety measures when docking down. I booked my ticket online and requested meals on all of my 4 flights via flydubai, but no meal was served to me, they said my name was not on the list so they cannot serve me any meal, so I offered to pay for a meal but they declined saying there is an exact number of meals for the exact number of passengers names on the meal list. So I asked for water, same story, there are not bottle of water, so I also offered to pay for one, but they also declined. A nice stewardess offered me tap water. If I had known that, I would have got some food and drinks from the duty free prior the flight. Entertainment, a 7 hour flight from Bangkok to Dubai should have movies or songs, but to my surprise, I couldn't watch without paying via credit card or cash (35 Derham ) while i've been on many airlines before and they never never asked for a payment to use the screen to watch movies, series or listen to music which was very frustrating. I ended up paying, money is no issue but it's about the concept. So basically, choosing flydubai, even though it cost less than the other airlines, but it also offers and provides way less than the others, so instead of saving 150$-200$ on a flight, when taking flydubai you are only paying for a seat to sit on instead of standing during the entire flight, nothing more.",Detractor

Did check in one piece of luggage and brought one carryon. They do weigh and coming back to US they weighed my carry on. My carry on was a bit overweight and so I took one item out and placed in my backpack. When we checked in we got an aisle seat and middle seat flying to Gatwick. Coming home we got an aisle seat and middle seat and no one sat in the window seat and so we got an entire row . Movies were updated and we brought our own air phones. They charge 3.00 if you need one. We bought our own meals from Gatwick airport 7.00 US and it came with a bottle of water. We will fly Norwegian again now that we know how it works. You can't beat the price. We flew on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.,Promoter
" Vancouver to Ho Chi Minh via Shanghai. We read reviews before leaving for Vietnam which seemed to be quite negative. We found the opposite on our trip. We had no issues with staff understanding English, there was more food, drinks including beer and wine offered than we have had on other airlines. The meals were good and frequent. The staff offered beverages throughout the flight. If you needed one and the staff weren't in the aisles you just needed to find them on the plane and they would get what you wanted. Plenty of room in the seats and lots of choices of movies etc to watch on the long flight. We had a great experience.",Promoter
" Terrible experience flying with SAS Scandinavian from London to Copenhagen. For starters, the baggage costs are something that is subtly mentioned when booking, meaning if you miss this, you will pay full price when you arrive at the airport. We were then told by someone that on our way back we should check in our luggage whilst checking in online (within 24 hours of our flight) for the cheaper price, turns out you have to check in your luggage 24 hours before your next flight - which meant we were charged full price for luggage costs again! No customer service number, rude/stubborn staff at the airport and on the phone (could only get through to their sales department). Avoid.",Detractor
" Rome to Barcelona. Totally a scam. We ended up paying for our seats after booking the flight. We could not get our tickets until we paid an additional fee. Then we paid $50 per checked bag. You had to buy everything on the flight including bottled water. A cup of water was free, but we had to ask 3 times to get it and the flight attendant acted irritated. Never will fly this airline again. Read the small print and beware you will pay additional fees.",Detractor
" Birmingham to Denver. Absolutely had a great trip! Love this airline, this was my 4th time flying with them and they all have been great! Being over 6' tall there is plenty of leg room. All my flights have been on time and the flight attendants were all friendly. You have to pay for you food and drink but for the money I saved on the ticket it's well worth the 2 dollars. My ticket was 156 round trip, well over 200 dollars cheaper then anyone else. Thinking about getting there frontier credit card and will definitely be booking a trip in the future.",Promoter
 Valencia to Palma de Mallorca. Yet again Vueling Airlines have excelled themselves. Last evening the flight was due to depart at 23.00. In the end it departed at 01.50 ! What was really annoying is that they displayed a message at the gate that further information would be forthcoming in 60 minutes - this was on screen for more than 2 hours. At the same time i had received both emails and text messages giving me totally different information. One of the emails had a click here for more info button - this gave me a departure time of 01.40 - which turned out to be correct. This information was available before 23.00 so why was this not communicated to everyone then? Even the gate staff (when they finally arrived at 24.00) didn't know this. All they were telling people is that it was likely to be 2 or 3 hours late. A total shambles. What I want to know is how do they keep their operating license? It is such a shoddy amateurish airline - why are the top management not fired for gross incompetence? By comparison Ryan Air and Easy Jet are perfect. I have flown with many airlines and Vueling are by far the very worst airline I have ever encountered. Why does IAG tolerate such poor performance ?,Detractor

I have used Thai Airways from Perth to Bangkok several times and usually have found the service good! However on Sunday 18 August the flight was 1 hour late in takeoff from BKK. I note this has happened before because it makes the flight late on return to BKK once after midnight arrival. Service on flight was poor to bad. And check in at BKK airport a disaster! I requested a seat farther to the front as of my age and legs but was put to the back of the aircraft!,Detractor
" Chicago to Oklahoma City. We were told that we had to check our carry-on luggage because it wouldn't fit in the overhead cabin. Once boarded, we saw the limited space and were shocked. The aircraft was very warm, small and uncomfortable. There were no plugs for devices nor were there any screens to view tv/movies. I was blown away with how little space there was, the lack of amenities and how cramped the flight was for the money we paid just to be on the aircraft. How is it we are now spending more and more money these days, yet going through hoops just to fly and getting less? There was little arm or leg room, no WiFi, there was water but no soap in the one restroom available, my armrest would not go up and the compartment holding the magazines was broken. I will think twice before boarding another United aircraft again.",Detractor
Auckland to Perth 777-200 Airbus. Always wanted to try a different airline to compared to the usual one we fly so gave Qantas a go. Big mistake we won't be making again. It was a long 7.5 hour trip when you are in economy class with very limited movement squeezed in like sardines in a can! No leg room and trust me we are not big people! Seats were like sitting on a thin wooden chair they were so thin and hard. Meals were very bland no taste and really not inviting should of eaten before the flight. Staff were okay did their job to the best of their abilities. Overall flight was good no roughness but really couldn't wait to get off as was so sore from sitting on the uncomfortable seats. Overall we felt ripped off with the price of the tickets and extra purchase of luggage at a ridiculous price per extra 5kg it was not worth the change in airlines.,Detractor

Chose Asiana for a business trip a fortnight ago from Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong and the experience was exceptional. Separate business check in was professional and efficient. Lounge staff notified me of my flight and guided me to the gates where business class passengers were given priority boarding. The aircraft was the newer Boeing 777 with flat bed seats. The 1-2-1 layout was very convenient and seats were perfectly designed to sit and sleep comfortably. Meals were exceptional especially with the extensive high end wine selections. Excellent AVOD with quality noise cancelling headphones. Crew were a standout and the service was excellent. As a regular business traveller I know what level of service to expect and Asiana no doubt went beyond my expectations and to date the best I've experienced.,Promoter
"  Gatwick to Montreal via Keflavik. Considering how little I paid for this flight, I was very satisfied. There is no entertainment on board, no free seat selection, and a fee for large carry-on or checked baggage, but this was all made clear before booking. My return flight from LGW to YUL was incredibly cheap, even booked last-minute. Check-in online was standard, and like other budget airlines, there is no free seat selection even at check-in. My primary complaint was with the boarding method/time. From LGW to KEF, boarding took a very long time (much longer than they had allowed time for) because every person has their carry-on checked and tagged, and many people have to pay fees based on the size of their bags. This made the boarding process very long, and as a result, the flight was 55 minutes late getting off the ground. From KEF to YUL, boarding was also approximately 15 minutes late (even with a half-full aircraft), and then we sat at the gate for another 30 minutes due to a paperwork issue. However, all these complaints aside, I arrived in YUL only 11 minutes behind schedule, which I thought was great. As for on-board service, the crew seemed friendly, and unlike other budget airlines, they were not pushy at all. A few passes with the refreshment trolly, and a single pass with the duty-free. Very tasteful in my opinion unlike other budget carriers that bombard you for a full flight making it impossible to sleep or keep to yourself. So, I have to say, overall I was very impressed with WOW and will most certainly fly with them again. For the difference in flight cost compared to other carriers, I could have actually purchased myself a brand new tablet for entertainment along with my flights and it still would have come out cheaper than the other airlines. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a cheap flight and you aren't travelling with large amounts of luggage.",Promoter

"  Washington to Gatwick via Reykjavik. Very disappointing experience all the way around. This trip involved four flights, every single one was delayed at least 90min. The first was delayed over three hours (that we spent sitting on the tarmac), causing me to miss my connection. They routed me the next day, so I was more than 24hrs late to my final destination. I asked about another airline or a different airport in London, and they refused to help. They were rude to everyone. And this was all because of problems with their plane, not weather or anything. My rebooked, day later connecting flight was delayed an hour because the plane was late coming in, again because of mechanical issues. We then sat on the tarmac for awhile beyond that, and no one ever told us why. Flight from Gatwick back to Reykjavik was about an hour late leaving, again hanging out on the tarmac with no information. And now I'm back in the airport, waiting to try to get home, and just got a message that this flight is delayed 90min. I'm guessing that is if we are lucky. They never tried to make it up on the first flight, not offering complimentary food or headphones or anything. I will try to avoid ever flying this airline again.",Detractor

Eventually I boarded the at 1900, so I waited more than 13h at the airport and only got 4 vouchers of 1500ISK which doesn't get you a lot of food. It was a sad experience to say the least. Despite being told WOW air would follow up, it has been 6-months and I haven't heard anything.",Detractor
"Leaving Newark yesterday the gate agent announced that ""all overhead bin room was full"" as boarding group 4 (out of 5) was beginning to board. They forced gate check of all carry-on bags for all the remaining passengers. On boarding there were tons of open overhead bins with room remaining including one right at my seat! Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead. United has adopted a new policy and attitude about baggage that is Draconian - they should be ashamed. I will not fly United even though they have the only non-stop flights to my most frequent destination.",Detractor

"  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Shanghai. Original Flight 2am on 20th December. Flight took off towards Shanghai but making a detour halfway through. The captain made an announcement in Chinese that the weather in Shanghai was so bad and couldn't allow our aircraft to land. No announcement was made in English. Most of the passengers were having international flights (connecting flights in Shanghai as I did) and there were some who didn't understand Chinese at all. They only realized it the moment we landed and there was a sign saying ""welcome to KL"". The counter only had 4 ground staff (2 men, 2 women) and only one of them was capable / authorized to rebook our flights via another airline etc. One of the ground staff told us 2 total different stories as to why we are back in KLIA - airspace in Vietnam restricted our plane from entering (however, the flight next to our gate was going to Xiamen using the exact route as we were, but they are able to fly regardless) and secondly that the air crews were now unable to fly as their ""working hours were up"". After negotiating for 2-3 hours, the ground staff finally said that they could get those who can reach their destination with a direct flight to another airline. I was able to get MAS tickets to Narita but leaving around midnight that day (I'll be only reaching Narita at 7am the next day). We were also given the choice to take the same plane later that night, 9pm but we would only arrive in Narita 12 noon the next day. Those who had to make connecting flights regardless were stuck with using the same plane. Compensation was lunch buffet and resting in a room until 6pm at Pullman Hotel. Poor management of the ground staff: We were made to bring our luggage to the hotel when they told us we didn't have to. No staff followed us to the hotel or picked us up. We had no update info on the flights. My flight was further delayed, the staff at the check-in counter couldn't tell us why exactly the flight was delayed again but there was another flight to China at 9pm (but not the same flight). Food on the plane was terrible. I asked for Chinese style breakfast which was plain porridge with no condiments/sauce, no side dish whatever sort (and small portion). Even the buns only came approximately 30 mins later and are served cold (they couldn't heat the buns up in time). In-flight entertainment: a screen that drops out from the upper compartment (mine was 6 rows in front of me).",Detractor

"Chicago to La Guardia and another zero star effort from United Airlines. I volunteered to give up my seat on an overbooked aircraft. There was no one at the gate so I went to United customer service. This must have been the first time the idle group of 15 workers have ever heard of an overbooked flight as they could not process (cognitively) what I was offering. After a few minutes, they referred me back to the idle gate (which we could see no one was there). Realizing that this was idiotic, I walked to one of the other NYC bound flight gates as we have 3 major airports in the US's busiest city. The good news was that there was a half empty flight leaving in 30 minutes! The bad news was that United said it would be too difficult to swap with such short notice. Despite being 8 feet from the jetway and presented with a situation which was both beneficial for myself and United, this was yet another insurmountable task. The lady was kind enough to tell me that my overbooked flight (which I have a ticket for) is going to be 2 hours late though. I fly for work every week. I have to take the cheapest airline as a company policy. Why can American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and even Frontier figure it out, yet 100% of the time, United has excuses and animosity towards its customers?

After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person.

Went to BKK via Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back to Thailand. I know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a good flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed - I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok.

Terrible experience from start to finish. We were delayed travelling to Iceland from New York by weather which is perfectly fine and expected due to the awful conditions but the service at Reykjavik airport was nothing short of shambolic. We missed our connecting flight because of the delay again which is fine and were put on a later flight to London then onto our final destination of Glasgow.

I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,Passive
SIN-CDG for particular schedule and price won't do again unless they have a complete overhaul of facilities. Business class was just poor and mean the 2-3-2 seating is unacceptable - had preselected aisle seat but when went to checkin online had been put in a middle seat. There was one available aisle left row 12 with toilets behind. Everything was just tacky lots of plastic and plastic wrapping on amenities - having disposable covers for the headphones is unpleasant - but probably necessary since the headphones appear fixed in the seat. Entertainment offerings were basic food exceedingly average. amenities pack basic blanket made of that rather nasty artificial velour-type material that feels like it will give you an electric shock. Seats uncomfortable headrest juts forwards armrests solid so can't use as arm rests. They may be upgrading their business class but should be discounting what they offer - I travel frequently and I've had better food entertainment systems and amenities in other airline's premium economy. This experience was by far the least of any business class I've flown in the last 5 years. Staff were fine doing their job politely.,Detractor

Recently flew to EZE and back from LHR. Longest flight on the BA network. In each direction the crew were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. IFE rather dated and choices were only average. Food was ok better than last year on this route. Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE which was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires). I fly this route perhaps twice a year 3 years ago it was all pretty diabolical but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly and the food is slowly improving.

" Atlanta to Seattle via Las Vegas. Low prices not worth the headache and frustration. On the first leg of a 3 leg flight I was prepared to give Spirit 5 stars. I knew somewhat what I was getting myself into for a cheap flight. I bought a flight across the country with 2 layovers for a cheap price. I accepted the sub par service checking into my flight at Atlanta Airport because I understand that the employee training program couldn't possibly be the best with what Spirit was charging (the workers at the check-in desk couldn't perform simple tasks, let alone come close to performing their actual job). I even accepted the uncomfortable seating in the aircraft with seats that don't recline and are so uncomfortable they caused me neck pain. The one quality I find unredeemable is unforeseen delays due to maintenance with no end in sight. This is the straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back. While I impatiently await the next 15 minute intercom call to tell me the aircraft is still broke I took this time to advise you: if you can afford to pay a little extra, I highly recommend you do. The one job I pay the airline to do is to deliver me to my destination with minimal delays and to keep me informed of any delays and they failed this task. This is the first time I flew with Spirit, and it will most definitely be the last.",Detractor

Positives: plane was clean and I arrived safely. Negatives: I have never encountered such rude flight attendants. The food served was inedible. For breakfast we thought we would order the pancakes as it would seem that this would be impossible to mess up. These were inedible. When I checked into our return flight to Sydney I requested an extra bag and provided all my credit card details at the time. Despite this we were charged for an extra bag at the airport.

"  Aer Lingus is a nightmare. I purchased a trip to Madrid from Boston with an hour layover in Dublin. Both legs of the journey were run by Aer Lingus. However, the gate distance and short time frame provided made it physically impossible to make the flight connection. I ran to the gate and they had already closed it-- I can't believe Aer Lingus sold the tickets as if it would be possible to make the connection. I rescheduled at the sales booth (this is why they get one point-- the woman working at the desk was super friendly and kind) but the next flight was not until 8 hours later so I had to stay in the airport. To top it all off they somehow managed to lose one of my two checked bags and it took them 3 days to get it to me in Madrid.

AV 007 July 2 2014 Miami-Bogota. AV 9207 July 6 2014 Bogota-Cali. AV 8420 July 10 2014 Cali-Bogota. Really disappointed about the development of Avianca - starting with their new ugly livery. The crew from Miami to Bogota were completely uninterested in attending to passengers after the meal was served. During the meal I asked for a wine and water. One attendant said: normally only one beverage is served per passenger! The cup of wine is tiny (half of a normal cup)! The food was a joke have never seen smaller portions on routes over 3 hours. 3 mini- strips of meat tasteless. No salt or pepper available on board. The airline is the only one I know with a Duty Free seller on board. I wanted to buy a whiskey but it was not available. This person was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. After arrival in BogotÃ¡ the crew did not say goodbye they were just packing their stuff. Who invented this terrible new seat? For small people maybe nice for tall people like me a disaster - the headrest hurts my neck. Seat pitch was better some years ago. The service on the domestic routes did not convince me either. They only serve bad coffee or artificial juices. The planes are new but not very well cleaned. Positive: All my flights were on time.

My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad.

Flight from Abu Dhabi to London 28 March. Transfer from an Air Seychelles flight easy but a long walk. Flight to London delayed but information board gave no reason and how long the delay would be. Ground staff didn't seem to know. A 90min delay. Flight full. Families had been separated and ground staff had no clue how to resolve and were just inept. Boarding chaotic with no order. Shame as once on board and off the ground the cabin staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. Food good - a snack bag to start with (flight left around 3am) and then hot breakfast prior to arrival. Good entertainment system. Seats somewhat cramped - they get in an extra seat across a 777 like Emirates - and seat pitch average. Good fares.

"  Stuttgart to Barcelona. Arriving at STR airport, everything seems fine. According to the airport flight monitor, there was no delay, sched. dep. 14:55. I also checked on the Vueling website and was shocked: new expected departure time 19:00 because of ""operational reasons"". But was the flight delayed or not? The airport still said the flight would be on time. So I checked in normally, went to the gate, the gate staff came on time and turned on their computer. Only problem: there was no aircraft at the gate. They knew nothing about the delay. When passengers complained and showed them the Vueling website with the delay, the staff announced: ""We don't know where the plane is, but according to passengers the plane didn't even take off from Barcelona."" We got food vouchers, but still no information whether the flight would even operate. 4 hours later, they announced a new departure time of 19:30. In the end, the plane departed at 19:55 - five hours later than expected. The flight itself was okay, the plane was very new, service was normal, the seat pitch was quite low. But they didn't want to comment on the delay, very unprofessional. The return flight had also a delay, but at least ""just"" 40 minutes. Customer service via E-Mail is an absolute horror, it takes weeks for an answer. Telephone hotline is constantly occupied. In short: the airline has the potential to be a good LCC, but their operations are just poor (nicely said). The customer gets zero information from Vueling, even the airport gets zero information. No customer service available. A lot of delays. The Airbus planes are in good condition, inflight staff is decent, seat pitch could be better. I'll try the airline again in the coming years, hoping they improved their operational difficulties.",Passive

"My wife and I recently traveled Melbourne-Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific. Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive â€˜economy' ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of â€˜economy' and not a lot of â€˜premium'. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago. Based on our recent experience I would not recommend Cathay Pacific â€˜Premium Economy' it does not represent value for money.",Passive
"  Boston to Raleigh. I will never fly on Spirit Airlines again. The price was incredible, I honestly couldn't believe the deal I got on this flight, however, once I flew the first leg I understood why it was so cheap. They literally charge you for everything, including water ($3 for a small bottle) and snacks on the flight. It wasn't so bad because it's only a 2 hour flight, so I didn't get anything. My major complaint is on the ride home. I got to the airport early, and then found out that my flight was delayed 30 minutes, which was no big deal, it's only 30 minutes. However, it got delayed 2 more times for a total of 4 hours. I walked up to the clerk and asked about rescheduling my flight, and found out it would be 24 hours for the next flight because they only have 1 flight a day that goes to Raleigh. Luckily I have family in the area and I stayed with them overnight. The next day I get to the airport and find out that my flight is delayed again.

Our luggage, however, was flown on to St. Louis without us on a different plane. There were so many flight cancellations and issues that our first available flight home was 3 days later, on March 17. United refused to compensate us for expenses incurred due to being separated from our bags because we do not fit the typical baggage delay case.

"Frontier happened to have a cheaper fare for my Atlanta - Denver flight. I arrived at the airport just over an hour before my flight which was very early in the morning. I had no bags to check and I figured it would be a brief swipe at the kiosk and I'd be on my way. I had no idea that Frontier has a 45 minute cut-off where they refuse to print boarding passes after that time, forcing you to miss your flight. The kiosk refused my information and wouldn't let me check in. I waited in line and watched the 45 minute timeline arrive and pass. By the time I got to the counter they refused to give me my boarding pass and suggested that I book the next flight at 8:10am. Frustrated, I called the airline with the number provided by the staff and was told it would be $100 to move me to the next flight, plus Frontier charges a $40 carry on fee? I'm used to paying $25 for my checked bag with Delta, which is why I made the effort to do only carry-on luggage this trip. I moved back over to the counter where there was no line and asked for my boarding pass. It was 1 hour before the flight. The staff told me the 45 minute window had closed again. Patiently, I told them I had gotten off the phone seconds ago and the woman told me that it was still ""open"" and that they could print my boarding pass. I also alerted them to the actual time. ""Oh"" was the response! Do they have any clue the extent of the inconvenience they cause by simply not using their few active brain cells? They printed my boarding pass - never once mentioning that my original flight had been delayed to 8:45 - thereby saving me $100 and the stress and hassle of dealing with their ineptitude. Their flight attendants are sweet and I have nothing bad to say about them, but the staff that book flights and checks people is a study in illiteracy.

" Johannesburg to Medina via Cairo. In January this year we embarked on a pilgrimage to the Holy Cities of Makkah and Medina. Our flights had been booked on Egypt Air. The agent who'd arranged the logistics of our journey assured us that Egypt Air was a decent airline and that our journey would be pleasant. We trusted him, since the journey to Medina, via Cairo, had been pleasant enough. We weren't overly concerned about the 23 hour layover in Cairo that loomed ahead of us on the return leg. He guaranteed us that EgyptAir would arrange accommodation for our group and that we'd be issued transit visas which would allow us to do a bit of sightseeing before setting off for home. The children were especially excited about this. A chance to see the pyramids! When we stood in the queue at their passport control, never had I encountered an immigration official this rude! He demanded that transit passengers sit down! So we sat. We were a fairly large group, it turned out. Twenty five South Africans and a smattering of Nigerians. Anticipating a long-ish wait, we got comfortable. Greeted our fellow wayfarers, shared what food we had among us and waited. It was two hours before a bus was sent to collect us. We were then driven to the main airport building where we were just told to go upstairs. Here we found an Egypt Air Customer Services desk where a handful of agents were dozing on desks. When someone finally rose to come and see to us, we were told that since we'd arrived early in Cairo, there was nothing he could do for us. There was no accommodation booked. We should go and sleep in the mosque. We were stunned. Egypt Air Customer services aren't big on responding to the same question twice, clearly. The agent became rude and surly at this point. Seeing that we would make no progress with this particularly unhelpful help desk at near 3AM, we sought out the prayer room. The ladies' section was just about empty. The ladies and children huddled in groups on the stone-hard floor and tried to sleep. It was freezing! For the men, the night would turn out being much more uncomfortable. The men's section of the prayer room was full of men who had hours to wait before their connecting flights.",Detractor

I literally booked a flight on one day, tried to change to a day later departure 24 hrs later only to find there was no flight. Cancellation fee of $99 was read as a credit toward future flights. No, I was wrong. It was a flat fee for spending 20 minutes on their website. Lost customer for life.",Detractor

"SAS use Lufthansa ground services at Munich airport, and their check-in staff was very friendly and helpful as this was my first time at the airport. I boarded a 2-hr flight in Munich and transited for long-haul segment of my trip at CPH. The best parts of the long-haul flight were the newly refurbished cabin and friendly FAs. Clean cabin and a comfortable Economy seat, decent leg room (but keep in mind I'm 5'4""), highly responsive IFE, high resolution touch screen. I wish there was more variety on the IFE, though. The worst part of the trip is that the food was cold and tasteless and they only offered one, just one, complementary juice with the first meal. It's a disappointment for a full-service airline on an 8-hour flight.",Passive
"First time I flew with United Airlines. I wasn't very happy that I was charged for my bags and wasn't allowed not even one bag free. I was forced to pay for my bag. This is unacceptable, because that same day I flew there were other United Airlines flights that were going out and I noticed that the other passengers from the other flights, were not being charged for luggage. I feel that the customers should be made aware of that you have need to pay for luggage. This is the last time I fly with United Airlines.",Detractor
" Portland to Las Vegas. After booking with Spirit, I read scores of negative reviews about delays, canceled flights, outrageous fees, and horrible service, and was very worried about my vacation. Then I saw something on reddit that made me feel much better. An honest reviewer said all problems are caused by 2 things. #1: Customers who don't do any research, read the terms and fees, then are upset to find them out. This is 100% their fault. #2: Delays and cancellations. This is almost always Spirit at fault. Before booking my flight, I looked over their web site and reviewed all baggage costs, maximum weight, and looked at pictures of inside the cabin. I also read several reviews on what to expect. Spirit does disclose all of this on their website. It is the customers responsibility to read it. If you don't, it is your own fault. Here is what I found out after I did my research. You get 1 free personal item (backpack, purse, laptop), carry on is $65 extra, checked bags are $40 if you pay online, or more if you pay in the terminal. Maximum 40 pounds or they charge for more. Seats are assigned unless you pay to pick a seat. No free drinks or food. You pay for it. Again, all of this is detailed on their website. Almost all the negative reviews I see are upset customers saying ""Oh my god they charged me $65 for my carry on! I am beyond furious and will never use them again!"" They do disclose this if you bothered to take 5 minutes and look, and before we boarded, a Spirit employee announced this over the intercom at least 4 times, and there were multiple signs. Listen and read! This is a no frills airline. No TV, no headphones, no wifi, no free food, and yes, the seats are extremely close and cramped. You are also paying much less than other airlines. I don't need luxury for 2 hours in the air. I prefer saving it. I checked other flights out of PDX and LAS for previous days on their website. Anything delayed or canceled? Not that I found. All of the left on time. Both airports had 2 flights out either that day or next day. For those customers complaining about being charged for carry on luggage, water, or picking a seat, if you spent 5 minutes and read their website, you would know that. Obviously you didn't even bother. That is your fault. Is Spirit perfect? Not even close. It's cheap and no frills. You aren't going to get a back massage or your feet rubbed. Do they have delays? Yes. I've flown United and AA, and they had them as well. Every airlines has problems. If you know what you are getting into, read reviews, fees, and know what to expect, there is nothing wrong with this airline. If you don't do any research, that is your fault, and you have nobody to blame for yourself. We have no complaints about our experience with Spirit Airlines.",Promoter
" Cleveland to Tampa via Dallas Ft Worth. We were supposed to leave Cleveland at 5:35, we didn't leave until 7:05. We had a connecting flight in Atlanta to go to Tampa. We were assured several times that we would make our connecting fights. When we were about halfway to Atlanta, we were told we would be arriving at 8:30 and that flights were being held, due to the fact that our flight was a connection for the majority of the passengers. When we landed, we discovered that none of the flights were held. We went to customer service and they booked us on the first flight the next morning. They didn't offer any apologies, were very unsympathetic, and rude. They refused to comp a hotel, so I ended up staying at the airport with my 2 year old daughter, her first flight. Her car seat was checked as baggage, so I couldn't leave the airport if I wanted too. This is the worst airline I've ever flown.

"  Paris Orly to New York via London. Unlike some American carriers and some other European carriers, there is no beverage service on short haul flights. Tea costs 2.30 pounds. Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the premium drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had. They replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options (cookies, snack-sized kit kats and snack-sized mars), you may only have one. I asked to have an extra snack, I was told no, only one. Onboard media is decent, but nothing to write home about.

AKL-PER in the 3x3x3 configuration. As regular Perth trippers (like 25 over 20 years) it was one of the most uncomfortable disappointing trips we have experienced. One needs to be almost a contortionist to extricate oneself for toilet visits due to 2 things. One is the closeness of the seat in front when it is reclined coupled with the fact that the intermediate arm rest will not lift high enough to get around comfortably but having achieved that one still has to negotiate around the aisle arm rest which would not lift at all! My wife and I are not high body-mass people! Food quality was definitely not up to previous standards. Trying to play a favourite CD became a rather user/unfriendly mission and when I did get it it was punctuated and disjointed. On disembarking we eyed the PE seats with new interest and are contemplating an upgrade on our return but it shouldn't have to be like that. We get the feeling that passenger comfort/satisfaction in the standard economy class has been compromised by the extreme pressure the airline is under to return a satisfactory performance to the shareholders. We remain loyal to our own airline but are seriously questioning the cost.,Passive

Allocated seating was good as there is no rush experienced with other low costers did not pay extra to get the option to choose the seats yourself but it would be great if they offered at least a few seats per flight to choose from without extra charge like regular carriers.

We waited in the lounge and upon checking the board, our flight status had been changed to a 20 minute delay, which was no big deal. Boarding was very quick due to only having to board 26 passengers. Once we were in the air cabin crew told us to sit where we wanted. The cabin crew were very nice, chatty and smiley.

BA213 Heathrow to Boston 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.,Detractor

"  I'll start off by saying that I'm not even 24 hours into this reservation with Spirit and I regret every second of this choice. I guess this airline is great if your a young adult with wonderlust and you travel with just a purse and a dream but if that's not you, then don't book it. They have what seems to be fair prices for flights (Los Angeles to Cleveland), but then come the charges and such. I traveled with my husband and upon going online to check everything out, we see that we can pick seats. Now, you can choose to have seats with more leg room and such but your going to pay. I thought we could just do the assigned seating thing - wrong! If you don't pay to choose your seats, they will just assign you wherever they want and whatever is left. So your spouse or child could be at the front of the plane, you in the middle, and somebody else in the back. We paid for the upgraded seats (they had more leg room anyway) and we were checking out to pay for that and they ask if we want to pay for our bags. We think, no that's OK, we just have a backpack each (2 day trip) so well just carry on - think again. If you have anything larger than a laptop bag you're paying. A carry on costs $42 each or you can join their $9 club to have your carry on only cost $31 each! Don't even ask how much a bigger bag is. So we did the natural thing",Detractor
"  A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to Boston. I have to say that my wife, daughter and I were completely pleased, somewhat surprisingly so. Quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in Sofia. Decent contract lounge. Excellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston. Terrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or Austrian. I have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals. All three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellent. Not as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business cabin. The middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid. There were four toilets for business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class. As the fight was not full, I probably could have gotten seats together at checkin, but I did not want to take the risk, and BA got additional revenue, which is obviously why they do it.",Promoter

I felt I was being held to ransom - this was an airBaltic error and any other company worth their weight would waive the charge with a smile in view of the fact that their original mistake allowed me to travel with a buggy and this was a return flight home. I insisted to speak to the customer service officer at the airBaltic office in Riga International Airport, who were just as unsympathetic, continued to blame London crew and insisted I paid. I was however given a feedback leaflet and told that I could fill that in if I wanted to voice my concerns over the handling of this situation - not helpful. When I requested to speak to a senior line manager, I was informed that no such person is available, despite me pointing out that this was a Friday - a working day and during office hours. To add insult to injury, the flight crew member actually flicked a ""talk to the hand"" gesture in my face when I asked her for assistance as myself and the two young children were attempting to settle into our seats! I have been a loyal customer (with PINS) to this company over a decade, electing to fly with this more expensive airline despite many cheaper alternatives available for the same route, but this is the most appalling customer service I have experienced from any company. This unacceptable treatment was most upsetting to me as a parent flying alone with two children. I expect airBaltic to take much better care of its loyal customers, parents with children and on a humane level - any person in their care. Following this incident I shall not be recommending airBaltic.",Detractor
"  Charlotte to Detroit with American Airlines. Packed mainline A319. No service whatsoever on a nearly 2-hour flight - not even water. Flight attendants ignored the call button. There was no turbulence, therefore the reason for this total lack of service remained unknown. I wonder whether this is the ""new normal."" Seat 9D (""main cabin extra"") had adequate legroom but was extremely narrow, so the overweight passenger in 9E constantly ""spilled over"" into my seat. Cannot recommend American in domestic coach over the discount carriers. Even Spirit and Southwest do better. (Spirit makes it clear that everything costs money and is happy to sell water and Southwest provides free drinks on flights of similar duration).",Detractor
" Dubai to Baku. I hadn't flown FZ since 3 or 4 years but I was impressed by the overall experience. We left on time, staff were very polite, the aircraft recent with leg space and more comfortable seats than the older versions. Flight was very smooth and the landing perfect. I went to Baku and came back the next day. The aircraft was delayed from Dubai 40 mins but the captain apologised and said he would try and catch up on route. The aircraft was 7 years old and my screen wasn't working, I asked the woman next me if we could display the flight info and that was fine. Flight also very smooth and great approach and landing.

" Singapore to San Francisco via Hong Kong. Worst flight ever. I paid for an extra legroom seat 41c. This seat is supposedly bulkhead but it isn't. This is an isle seat which has the isle for the cabin directly in front of it. This means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. In fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. You can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. The crew just grinned each time I was jarred awake. Only once did they say sorry. I complained and the airline said sorry it hasn't been an issue before. Most airline these days have a good movie selection, not this one. Food was awful. Glad we had our own water as they hardly bring any around. I know this is a long flight but the crew were terrible.",Detractor
Flew Brisbane - Dubai - London on A380. We were lucky enough to snag seats 32 J&K which are a pair of bulkhead seats in the economy section on the upper deck. It was a peaceful oasis at the back of the plane. Seats were comfortable and we had plenty of legroom due to the bulkhead. Storage bin in the side was excellent for storing handbags coats etc for easy access. Service from staff was excellent. Very friendly and efficient. Food was surprisingly very good. Drinks and fruit/snacks were offered regularly throughout the flight. I hope we are able to snag these seats again next time we fly. So much better than the downstairs economy section. IFE was good with plenty of movies games TV shows and music to choose from. All in all a very satisfying flying experience.,Promoter
What used to be superior service has slipped dramatically. Have used Korean Air twice a year for the past 8 years to fly Canada to Thailand where we are expats. Customer service standards are lower food quality and service is poor. Was not offered a drink of any sort in 8 hours. Air crew did not know anything about transfers late departures on 2/2 flights. It is very disappointing to see Korean Air service dropped so much. Even the air crew does not smile anymore or offer assistance. 7 hours between meals no snack offered or available. They have lost my business especially after yesterdays lost luggage debacle. If you are looking for a quality flight don't waste your money. Cathay Pacific picks up where Korean Air has left off.

"I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was appalling. The crew strutted around, barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. They ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized. On boarding, my 5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food all over it. I asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. When I asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said, ""You only get oreo cookies as dessert with a child's ""economy"" meal"". First off, I had paid $4000 per ticket for our Business Class tickets so the concept of ""child's economy meal"" didn't arise. I will never fly them again.",Detractor

I highly recommend CIA. Our flight was on time, no delays. Staff were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment.

" Sydney to Bangkok 14 June. Having flown with the domestic arm of Qantas 36 hours before on what could only be laughable such was the pathetic organization, an urgent need to fly to Bangkok which meant the first available flight ex Syd and given I had domestic connections, Qantas was the only choice. Flight departure delayed and no information forthcoming as to why. Eventually informed we would be boarding late due to the 'late arrival'. Aircraft departs gate , Capt. advises technical problem and we return to gate only. Pax sat there waiting, waiting. Finally departed 2 hours late adding more stress to our already stressed circumstances. We were in Row 45 and whilst seated there observing the young female cabin crew member seated at the exit adjacent to us, having a wonderful conversation to 2 passengers also in row 45 seats A & B - only to hear the cabin crew member offer as soon as the seat belt sign went off, a drink (alcoholic) in real glasses - not the plastic served to other members in cattle class - whilst we looked on and waited (remembering we already had departed / waited 2 hours late) for what appears to be Qantas' mandatory 2 hours waiting time before they start serving drinks / meals after take off. This is a shambolic airline and given the circumstances behind the reason for travel, left us with a very sour taste in our mouth.",Detractor
I've been a Qantas frequent flyer for a number of years now and fly with them domestic for the most part. For international flights I avoid them like the plague as they are expensive and the service is sub par. This particular flight was BKK-SYD and I was just relieved I was able to secure an aisle seat (with the added bonus of the spot next to me being unoccupied). Online check in was not available for this flight for some mysterious reason. The cabin crew need a lesson in grooming and customer service ASAP. All of them looked bored and somewhat angry. The service as usual was disinterested and disconnected. Breakfast was just thrown at the passengers. One of the ladies looked like she just rolled out of bed and one of the male attendants needs to shave so as one doesn't look like they've been awake for 24 hours. The food service was mediocre (as usual). Most notable was their 'breakfast' which was a small muffin yoghurt and orange juice. Please note that in their domestic flights (ie SYD-MEL) this is almost the same amount of food that's served. In a 9 hour flight with a 4 hour gap between the dinner and breakfast service one is left rather starving.,Passive
"  So disappointed with American Airlines. We have been loyal customers for 15 years and were recently notified that our card was hacked through their system and 150,000 miles were stolen. Instead of going after the perpetrators, they let us know that we had to file a police report and that they could not help us. We repeatedly asked to have them call us to discuss the matter and they would only email. The one person my husband was able to talk to told him ""you should reply to the email so they know you are responsive, and they will take you more serious."" We have never had such an ordeal with any company we have done business with. Customers for 15 years and that doesn't make a bit of difference. Such a shame. We have had to take matters into our own hands. I know this is actually a huge problem with American Airlines and having miles stolen as I have heard similar stories. They should think about better security and help support the loyal customers they have.

Roundtrip flight from Cairo to New York JFK with connection in Abu Dhabi. The problem happened with returning flight from JFK to Cairo specifically the second flight from AUH to CAI. The flights was supposed to take off at 00.50 24th November 2014. We boarded the aircraft but we stayed 2-3 hours due to fog after which we were transferred back to the airport. The fog cleared at around 7am. Nevertheless there was no real updates about the flight. The flight took off at 1:00 PM after 12 hours from the designated take off time.

However, the A319 to LAX was boarded on time, oversized baggage sent to the hold, and room for our carry-ons above our seats. Travelled in economy, with no one in front, so had no problems with the seat comfort or pitch. In fact, the seat was more comfortable than our LH Business Class, A319, LHR-FRA.

We filed a complaint straight away and waited 19 months for a reply which basically said tough luck. Wow air clearly didn't even read our complaint as all they replied was it's our fault because we were not there on time. Our parents were in front of us and they got on the flight.

"  Frankfurt to Wuhan via Changsha / Guangzhou. Overall dissatisfactory experience on for the most part older aircraft with no touch screen and little legroom on the A330. Food on the long haul segment of the flight was relatively good, whilst English service was bad. Safety video is extremely old school. No English magazine on the long haul, then on the domestic flight they had one - bizarre! Changsha as a stopover was a disaster. Though checked luggage is forwarded, you have to leave the aircraft, go through immigration and landside security check, led by an employee who ""tries"" to lead the group. All this in a hurry to catch the same plane again. Back in the plane, one passenger seems to be missing. Stewardesses walk along the corridor 10 times (!) trying to count passengers with their manual counter (seems to be a China Southern thing - extremely annoying and unprofessional). NO info from crew or cockpit whatsoever (in English or Chinese) for 2 hours! After 2 hours water is served. Followed by take off shortly after. Also unnecessary long (roundabout) ways in Guangzhou Airport: while the plane lands at a domestic gate, a bus is provided for all travelers from Frankfurt, which brings you again to the international terminal, which is especially inconvenient when you have to catch a domestic onward flight. China Southern also disappoints by saving on drinks on domestic flights, meaning a bottle of water only!

"  Tokyo Haneda to New York via Beijing. I've flown with Air China on three trips and the experience has gotten better every time. Not largely due to anything Air China has done differently, but because I've adjusted my expectations and I've gotten better acquainted with airport and inflight regulations. The mode of operation of Air China comes across more as a hard and fast checklist, rather than keeping customers comfortable or even satisfied. I've had to be rather forceful and persistent when I make requests inflight. That way, my requests as a paying customer are usually met. The cabin crew aren't usually the most inviting or pleasant but keeping busy with the entertainment system is a good distraction. The entertainment system is decent, even on a 13 hours journey. Try your hardest to stay away from aisle seats. The aisles are narrow and you're sure to be disturbed by constant bumping from passengers and crew alike. The menu is rather limited but the meals aren't the worst- balance of flavours and sizeable servings. The seating comfort is pretty average too. I'm 6'1 and it works. Lastly, though the expectation is for the crew to be multilingual, English isn't a strong suit for all attendants. I've always used simple English and I get by. I'll continue choosing Air China because of their prices and punctuality. Yes, the service can be rather dry, but it isn't abrasive or intolerable. I just need to get where I am headed, with the security of being on time, fed and safe, and that's what I've gotten from Air China..",Passive

"Good experience but unfortunately, mediocre seats. It was an afternoon flight from Sydney to Singapore - on one of Qantas's old A330s. The seats were recliners, which in itself was not an issue for a daytime flight. However, even with the extra seat cover, the cushion was still inadequate. The cabin is old and tired, and the IFE unresponsive at the best of times, with a tiny selection of movie, and appalling resolution. It ought to have been banished to the last decade. The food was overcooked and over-salted, but the selection of Australian and international wine remained excellent. The saving grace of the flight was crew, who were warm, friendly, and used my name. I was looked after very well. I should point out that when booking on the Qantas page, there is no way of telling whether the A330 is refurbished or not - yet, the prices are the same. When there is such a massive difference in quality between the old and refurbished cabin, it is indeed very disappointing to leave this crucial piece of information. After all, we pay a premium in hope of a much improved service and make the decisions comparing other competitors (Such as BA, CX or SQ).

The cabin crew was very friendly. Since the A340 isn't the newest of planes, the inflight entertainment system was pretty old as well.

They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this.

After checking in the clinic at T3 of Changi Airport, it was clear we couldn't continue our route. Instead, our baby had to go to a Hospital in Singapore. Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn't say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry. We like to thank all the involved people from SIA and Changi Airport - you helped us when we needed it the most. Once our baby was healthy again and could be discharged, SIA helped us with our luggage and checkin in, making sure it all goes smooth. We had our bassinet seat, the flight in the A380 was good as can be with a baby. Onboard staff was attentive and supportive, food was OK.",Promoter
Austrian still fly a Fokker 100 on this route. Admittedly in good conditions but basically an old plane from the 1980s. The service is limited to drinks and some nibbles. The flight assistant addressed me in German and when she realised I did not speak the language she made a face as if speaking English was a big inconvenience to her. If I can avoid Austrian in the future I will.,Detractor
VNO - LPL. Waited 45 minutes with 150 other people at the bottom of a flight of stairs after boarding isn't something myself or other passengers enjoy luckily I managed to sneak in front of a few passengers upon actually boarding the A320 itself. Onboard absolutely no complaints friendly cabin crew and a smooth flight. Would use again if going to VNO.,Promoter
Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. Spacious and colourful. Comfortable seats. Much better than hanging around the terminal. We have used it a few times. Plenty of booze. Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked in online. Baggage drop off. No problems. Plane was parked on the tarmac. Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's. FA's very pleasant and friendly. Even offered me a 4th G&T which I declined. All in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). Landed ahead of schedule.,Promoter

"  In the last 2 weeks I am reminded why I stopped using China Southern for China domestic flights. As I sit on the plane for the flight from Chongqing to Shanghai PuDong without moving for 90mins (last week it was 3hrs before we moved) I remember that travelling China Southern is most likely for delays and worst of all, are most likely to board you then do nothing for hours. As I look around and notice I am in fact the only foreigner on the plane I realise that all of my foreign friends have already got the message and learnt to stick with it. No more China Southern for me.",Detractor

MSP-KEF-CPH and back. Impressed with the space and legroom in Economy Class. We also liked the multiple entertainment options at each individual seat. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful and welcomed us with blankets and pillows as we boarded the plane. The only negative was the fact that we were served only drinks (no complementary food) but we were told this in advance so we prepared by bringing our own snacks. There was food for purchase and all items were reasonably priced and tasty. KEF is an easy airport to navigate and their passport control was quick and efficient to move us through processing during a short layover. We will definitely fly with Icelandair again and since they have recently opened some new gateways in the U.S. and Europe we will definitely be considering these options on our next international trip.,Promoter

"My experience from Barcelona to Toronto on Air Canada Rouge was different than when I flew from Toronto to Istanbul on Air Canada. The boarding process in Barcelona was chaos - it was slow and people didn't know where they were to stand or when they were to board. We ended up leaving almost 30 minutes late which compromised the time to clear security/customs in Toronto for the connecting flights. Onboard one attendant was terse and unforgiving when a passenger successfully stowed a bag in the upper bin, only to have another passenger open the bin and that's when the attendant wrestled out the bag and told the passenger it was too big for the bin and had to be checked - it was already stowed away! Also, we didn't know until we boarded the plane that in-flight entertainment only worked on our personal devices and your app had to be installed prior to boarding - that's too late to let us know. The trip from Toronto to Istanbul was the opposite - very quick boarding and extremely friendly and accommodating crew.",Detractor
"  Chicago to Dallas. I am writing this review to counteract the bad ones. We had no problems flying from O'hare to DFW and back. In fact, the aisles are wider and I had more leg room than on other airlines because I sat in the emergency row. No one likes fees and free pretzels would have been nice but I survived. The service was comparable to United or Delta. Pleasant and nice. In fact, our flight arrived early at the destination and the terminal was still full from another plane. There was around a 10 minute delay because they let 4 people on the plane late! Wow! I am applying for a credit card which gives you a free flight from the beginning. I'm not sure if we got really lucky but would fly again. Maybe the new CEO is turning everything around.",Promoter
"Recently flew Beijing-Istanbul return specifying a direct flight on ticketing. Only staying 36 hours on return journey and told by Chinese Embassy Melbourne I didn't need a visa as Beijing is 72 hours visa free. Flight to Istanbul stopped in Urumqi becoming last port in China for passport control. Immediately set off alarm bells for return trip as Urumqi has only 24 hours visa free. Tried unsuccessfully to rectify situation in Amsterdam and Istanbul - total lack of customer service in both cities. Arrived in Urumqi and at Passport Control escorted to Immigration and for 4 hours passport and documentation handed from person to person. Eventually granted visa for extra 10 hours. Luggage had been removed from flight which had proceeded to Beijing. Eventually told no seats available to Beijing until 24 hours later and the airline would provide a hotel with meals. I would not consider being detained on a military base a hotel. Collected by a soldier in khaki in a utility vehicle and entered a guarded military base to a 'hotel' with no name. Soldiers on drill around me. No English spoken no wifi or Internet. Meal consisted of a bowl of soup whilst the Chinese ate 2 courses with seconds! Breakfast not much better. I would like to point out at this stage I had a valid visa for 34 hours in China. Next day at the airport soon discovered I wasn't booked on said flight - I was on standby. The 1.5 days I had planned in Beijing including accommodation costs were ruined resulting in a few hours between flights at the airport. At no stage was I apologised to by the airline for its misleading information or Immigration. I have contacted China Southern demanding they inform passengers flight is not direct and passport control is through Urumqi so this situation doesn't reoccur. After numerous emails each time from a different person (same as in Urumqi) this has been the response "" sorry for that"". Not good enough. Don't fly with this dreadful airline. Service on and off aircraft non-existent.",Detractor
My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,Promoter
  Melbourne to Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Entertainment system not working so my 6 year old had a rough time on a 13 hour flight.

" Return sector from Taipei to Frankfurt via Shanghai-Pudong, including an overnight layover in Shanghai. Check-in staff in TPE to my surprise told me that my suitcase cannot be checked through to FRA as PVG is ""not an Air China hub, unlike PEK"". Since the check-in staff did not work directly for Air China, I did not make a direct complaint, but this must be mentioned when booking a connection itinerary. The assumption when booking this kind of flight with both legs operated by the same airline is that bags will be checked through to your final destination! This meant that I had to clear customs and haul my suitcase into central Shanghai for the less than 24hrs layover. Furthermore, the transfer visa staff at Pudong was very rude. I did not have my full itinerary printed in this electronic day and age (just my confirmation number written down) and immigration staff insisted on seeing a copy of my onward journey (as I also didn't have my boarding pass for the onward flight because TPE staff could only check me in to PVG). No Wifi is accessible in Pudong Airport to travellers without a Chinese SIM card, meaning I was unable to access my booking on my phone/iPad, unbelievable! This meant that the immigration staff had to physically go to Air China to check the passenger list for tomorrow to see if I'm on it, making me wait 30 min at the counter. Service onboard is below average and smiles seem faked. The food and drinks offering is substandard with none of the alcoholic beverage offerings on other carriers. My IFE touchscreen was very hard to navigate (touch function almost broken), meaning that pausing a film when going to the toilet was not possible easily. Film selection very limited, outdated and often in Chinese. Advice: Avoid Air China stopovers like the plague, however tempting it might seem to explore Beijing or Shanghai! And avoid Air China in general if you have other choices. It's definitely worth spending an extra 100 bucks for service and comfort (especially since my layover costs amounted to this much anyway).",Detractor

My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us.

The flight times from Birmingham to Barcelona worked out along with the cost of the flights and having recently seen Ryanair's marketing campaign to make themselves more customer friendly we felt it was time to try them again. I made the mistake of not checking in online which I realised was against company policy and by the time I had tried to do this the two hour curfew was on and I couldn't do it. This meant checking in at the airport for the sum of Â£70 per head (Â£140 in total) for myself and my wife. I completely understand the argument of a web based airline and would expect to have to pay extra for the privilege but those sort of charges are punitive and unfortunately destroy the more customer focused marketing approach Ryanair are trying - a shame!,Detractor
" Business Class from Bogota to Paris. The plane was great and service on board to but when I got to Paris my 2 bags didn't. Because I had a connection in Bogota I took my time to ask the person in the counter if he could check if my bags where on board, I flew Business from Medellin in Avianca, and the AF person left me a couple of minutes waiting before boarding, I suppose checking if my bags were ok and he told me I was fine. The connection was like 1 hour and if my bags had priority on them I assume there would be no problem. When I got to Paris, as I already told, my bags didn't arrive and I went to the service counter of Air France to ask for help. The first response was go to the carousel again for 30 minutes more, I had waited like 45 minutes, that sometimes bagas appear. I did as I was told and then went back to file my missing baggage. This time they filed my request and told me they will contact me for future delivery because my bags hadn't reached Paris and they didn't know where they were. For the next 4 days I was not reached by Air France by email, phone or anything regarding my bags. I called them several times and the answers were: first we haven't located your bags and then the bags are in process of being delivered to you. Also I tried to check the status of my bags on their site, as I was told I could do, but the system never gave me accurate information. Finally the 12th my bags finally had arrived with no previous contact with me to arrange the delivery or even to let me know finally my bags were on Paris. Just a single paper saying 1 zip open on the small suitcase. When I checked my bags the smaller one had thelock broken. I filled the complain at AF following their procedures and until now more than 20 days later the only contact from AF has been an automated e-mail. I just expect AF to compensate me for the basic things I had to buy.",Passive

 Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference.

I'm a pretty jaded frequent flyer, but was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and professionalism of everyone from check-in to the lounge to the cabin crew, who were wonderful and truly seemed like they enjoyed their jobs. On every flight someone even made a point of recognising my OW Emerald status, which I never even get on British Airways (through which I have said status). The A350 is gorgeous and I found the Economy seats perfectly comfortable (unlike some reviewers), despite my general dislike of economy seats in general. Would love to try it to Asia sometime.

"Flew 4 segments (Siem Reap - Bangkok Bangkok - Yangon Yangon - Bangkok and Bangkok - Phnom Penh) with this so-called boutique airline and we were sorely disappointed. All 4 flights were late. I can see why they are late because they obsess over checked luggage being 3 pounds over and then make you re-pack and carry one of your formerly checked bags. It certainly delayed everyone else in line. The next flight we were chastised because we had an extra carry-on which of course the other agent made us use. Finally and most egregiously - on the last flight we had been booked with a supposedly legal one hour connection in Bangkok. Of course the in-bound flight was 55 minutes late but we were met at the gate by an employee who was there to 'help' us. Her help was to start running a quarter mile or so through the airport with no assistance with our carry-ons and no electric cart. My wife and I are in our 60's. We finally got to the gate and in fact got on the plane - the only good thing about this story - and then waited another half hour for other delayed passengers from another late Bangkok flight.

" Newark to Orlando. The experience is horrible. At the check in they had no vacant seats together so they didn't assign me a seat, saying they will do that at the gate. At the gate they gave us seats 7B, 19D and 24D!! That meant My 5 years old child was seating alone 5 rows behind me. The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional, they didn't even apologize, and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier. The whole situation is ridiculous! Jet Blue's decision was: to put us on another flight or fly as it is! We asked a few people to change their seats but they refused the suggestion. When I buckled up My child he couldn't understand what is going on and of course started to cry. He didn't want to be separated or to sit with someone he didn't know, even though the couple next to him was very sweet. I was too stressed to deal with this and tried to talk to him about it.

I walked up to the attendants behind the counter, he told us due to weather they had to cancel, but we can talk with someone at the Terminal to find out what our options were. My mother and I had to go across the airport to talk about rescheduling our flight. We found out that the next available flight was on Saturday, June 13th. We couldn't wait that long. I started to look on Spirit's website and found a flight to Cleveland, OH. This was somewhat close to where we needed to go. He rebooked our flight but there was no compensation for the inconvenience or a â€˜Sorry' for the hassle. On our way back from Detroit, our fight was delayed yet again for about 2 hours.

Flew Auckland to Guangzhou and return in the past week. The in-flight service was terrible on the way back to New Zealand and services were carried out without a single smile from any of the cabin crew. All the cabin crew had minimal English and were abrupt and inclined to give passengers any meal or drink irrespective of what was requested. They made assumptions that just because we spoke English we would therefore have an English meal. A smile would go a long way. Snacks were seen down in the kitchen area of the plane but we did not once have any of this offered. Hygiene standards questionable. When I went down to the back of the plane for a stretch and to ask for a glass of water I was ignored. Another hostess on her return trip back to that area answered my request once I caught her eye but all done without any eye contact or smile or any verbal exchange. Would not fly this airline again. For an international airline one would expect a better level of English language. At the end of the flight only one cabin crew in sight at the aircraft door and she was busy doing things so even if one wished to say thank you there was no one to say it to.,Detractor
Air Canada used a small and (24yr) old A319 on this Vancouver to Ottawa route. The first class seats are wide however with not much legroom so you feel a bit squashed on this 4+ hour flight.

Done 5 different internal flights in China so far and this was the worst. Delay of 75mins at airport, not a word of apology from airport personnel or onboard the flight. The Captain was silent from start to finish - truly! My neighboring fellow passengers were coughing up phlegm most of the flight, all very unpleasant. Served some type of filled bun, but the smell deterred me and passed on this. Asked for coffee, the female FA shook her head, snarled something in Chinese and walked off.

"Don't fly with American Airlines! Having booked our business class flight with British Airways we had to use American Airlines from LAX to Honolulu. We had a 6 hour wait in LAX for our ongoing flight so decided to use the American Airlines lounge. Fat chance! We were refused entry as we weren't members! Even after explaining that we were flying business class we were told we were not allowed in. Having flown all round the world over the last 20 years many times in business class, we have always had access to lounges. Not according to the American Airlines agent! So after biting our tongues, we eventually got onto the flight to Hawaii. What fun. The cabin service manager was rude and obnoxious. The food was the worst we have ever had, even flying economy. Even telling the Cabin Manager about the food, all she did was pick up the tray and make no comment. There was a young Hawaiian hostess who was sweet and smiled at everyone. So what was the problem with her boss? The seats were uncomfortable even though they were supposedly First Class. We had made the mistake of having front row 1D and 1F and we were so close to the bulkhead we couldn't stretch our legs. Don't have bulkhead seats! Return flight to LAX we changed our seats to non bulkhead which helped with the legroom. Went into the AA lounge in LAX and were greeted nicely and given access. We then asked why we were refused entry before, only to be told that it was a mistake as we had the right to use the lounge! We should have asked to see a supervisor to check our status! Pity they put untrained staff in a business lounge. Having got entry into a lovely quiet and spacious lounge we were disappointed to find a total lack of food except to crackers and cheese. We had been given 3 drink vouchers each so we could get something to drink. Why is it that other airlines give you no restriction on drinks? The next flight was from LAX to LHR on a new Boeing 787. Nice plane and nice business class seats. Hostess were quite attentive but again totally let down by the quality of the food unless you like over cooked steak for dinner and leather scrambled eggs for breakfast! Why is it other airlines can get things right but American Airlines have grumpy staff and absolutely terrible food?",Detractor
LGW-PEK-HKG. LGW to Beijing on a A330 delayed 40 minutes and was completely full. Reasonable inflight AVOD entertainment system containing a selection of Chinese and Western movies. Food served was edible and expected from economy class. I liked was the super fast removal of food trays. Beijing International Airport is huge and with less than 2 hrs to catch our connecting flight proved stressful. Found no time to relax look around or for something to eat. Onward flight on a A320 seemed to have more legroom. On arrival at Hong Kong in the early afternoon one of our bags had not been put on our flight but fortunately delivered to our Hotel later that evening. Found return journey stressful due to time constraints. Flight delayed and so had just over an hour to get our connecting flight. Fortunately flight delayed 25 minutes so we managed to get on board. Our ticket price to HKG was quite cheap but I probably will not consider this route again.,Passive
 Flew Milan to Palermo. This was the worst airline experience I've had. My carry-on is exactly the measurements Alitalia approves of and I had just flown with it (with the exact same contents) on six other airlines around Europe. The woman at the counter said it was one kg above the limit and I asked to take my shoes out and put them in my backpack. She declined as she had â€œalready printed my reciept to pay for a checked bagâ€. It was â‚¬45. â‚¬45 for a pair of shoes that easily fit in my backpack. The least helpful people to work in customer service. They give absolutely no reason to come back.,Detractor
AC1906 YYZ to VCE on Sat 30 Aug 2014. Booked ticket 8 months in advance: No inflight entertainment system not at all not even the old TV screen on the upperhead. You need an iPad to download a specific application to use the inflight system and iPad alone because they do not sponsor Galaxy. Seats are small with tight leg space (flew a 767-300).

JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.,Promoter
Stockholm to Bangkok. Flight was pretty much on time and they weren't as strict with carry ons as other budget airlines but those are the only 2 good things I have to say.

"  My daughter qualified to compete in the 2017 NCAA track & field championship in Eugene, Oregon. As such, I purchased 8 round-trip tickets for family and friends on Spirit Airlines from Minneapolis to Portland. The outbound flight, with connection in Chicago, was fine. The return flight from Portland to Minneapolis (through LAX) on June 11 was a disaster for the 15 Minneapolis-bound passengers. The flight from Portland to LA was scheduled to leave at 3:15 p.m. but was finally pushed back to 4:08 p.m., scheduled to arrive in LAX at 6:27 p.m. The avowed reason for the plane's delay arriving in Portland was â€œair traffic controlâ€ reasons. Our connection to Minneapolis was scheduled to depart from LAX at 6:29 p.m. so, not surprisingly, the 15 Twin Cities' bound passengers were a bit nervous about meeting their connection in LA, and actively seeking alternative flights from Portland to Minneapolis. Prior to getting on the plane, the lead Spirit agent on the desk in Portland guaranteed the Twin Cities' passengers that they would be able to meet their connection in LA to travel to the Twin Cities. Moreover, he assured the Twin Cities' passengers that even if we did not make our connection in LA, that Spirit would get us back to the Twin Cities that night on another airline. He also said (correctly) that the connection in LA would be easy because the arrival gate was literally right next to the departure gate for the Twin Cities. With those assurances, all 15 Twin passengers boarded the Spirit Airlines flight from Portland to LA confident they would get back to the Twin Cities that night. We touched down at LAX around 6:15-6:20 p.m. and the plane scurried to the gate. When we exited the plane and took the 15-20 steps to the adjacent departure gate for the Twin Cities' bound flight, we were shocked to see that the plane had just left the gate. We could literally see the plane 100 feet from the window. The Spirit supervisor in LA said that Spirit would not authorize putting us on a flight on another airline to the Twin Cities. The remedies suggested by the Spirit staff to remedy were laughable, for example, they could put us on a red-eye to Baltimore or Philadelphia, and then fly to the Twin Cities, getting us back the next afternoon at 2:00 p.m. The default seemed to be that everybody would simply remain in LA until the next day and board Monday's 6:29 p.m. non-stop flight from LA to Twin Cities. The LA supervisor further said that the airline would not be responsible for hotels and other costs, as the flight delay was not due to a mechanical failure, but rather to air traffic control issues. As to the reason for the Spirit plane leaving us behind, the answers provided by the Spirit staff on-duty were pretty vague, but finally one of the staff said that one of the most important reasons was to allow Spirit customers on the flight to the Twin Cities the opportunity to meet their connections in the Twin Cities. The plane arrived in the Twin Cities at around 11:30 p.m. â€“ connections at that time of night, really? Frankly, I doubt that any passenger on that plane had a close connection in the Twin Cities at that time of night, and for sure not on a Spirit plane. Spirit planes, flight crew, and cabin crew seem okay for a budget airline. However, I would say that the Spirit operations folks and gate supervisors are really at the bottom of the barrel. Be very careful if you take Spirit Airlines, and particularly if you have a connection.",Detractor

" Terrible airline. Would not recommend to anyone. Every single flight was delayed, causing us to miss connections. No food or vouchers were offered, sometimes having to wait in the airport for 10 hours without food. One of our flights randomly landed in Azerbaijan to refuel, adding an additional two hours to the flight time. The flight itself was uncomfortable, no entertainment, one meal served in 9 hours which was bland. Only water available as a drink. Seats dated and uncomfortable. Staff were generally rude and unhelpful, both at the airport and on the flight itself. Additionally, for some reason the plane that was used was small and we felt every small bit of turbulence.

"  I have never flown Rouge even though I have flown Air Canada forever. Unfortunately, I was not prepared for what I had to look forward to. Flew from Toronto to Fort Myers. I stand 6'3"" and, literally, could not sit with my legs in front of me. I was incredulous! I looked around to see if I was in a narrow row but soon found another tall guy who had the same look on his face. For three hours I had to sit with my knees apart and I still couldn't sit without my knees touching the seat in front of me. I had to fight off some cramping along the way as well. The seats are equally as bad. It may have been more bearable if I could at least move around a little to shift my weight around but because I was wedged in I could barely move. I wrote Air Canada to describe my experience in a bit more detail but more importantly to remind them why I am now flying with one of their competitors.",Detractor

"A short hop Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Two adults and a child cost me about 215 euro. Plane was late getting into Amsterdam. No announcement was made about this at any stage so we sat and waited expectantly. It landed 30 mins before take-off time so pretty happy to be only 25 mins late leaving. Flight was very smooth. Coffee/ tea served but very limited options for food to purchase if you wanted. Slightly concerned about the continual loud clunking noises coming from bottom of plane as we landed and the rather high-pitched squeal that accompanied us from the runway all the way to the gate. Can't complain too much as it was cheap and got me there, but I did leave the plane feeling a bit uneasy.",Passive
"I travel quite a bit and have been a fairly loyal Air Canada flyer. I don't think I even realised that Rouge was different to regular Air Canada when I booked, but I will never travel Rouge again. The seat space was tiny (if the person in front of you has their seat back and you drop something on the floor, you cannot get it - there is not enough room to bend forward to pick it up - unbelievable). There was no entertrainment system, and the food was terrible. On the way home from Dublin, we were delayed by 14 hours because the plane we were supposed to be on had trouble leaving Toronto and there was no other plane. I guess Rouge does not use other Air Canada planes - we had to wait for a Rouge plane to become free. I will never use Rouge again. The price was no different.",Detractor

Initially the our flight was delayed 30 minutes for bad weather. We were not upset about that. However, once all the passengers were boarded, we were asked to unload because of a mechanical sensor issue which took another 2 hours to fix. We ended up having to stand in long lines and rebook our connection 3 different time. All in all an 8 hour delay! When we finally got back on that flight, the pilot says they have to fuel up!! They couldn't have done that when they were fixing the sensor?!?! If that whole situation wasn't unfortunate enough, we got bumped from our original return flight and are now getting home over 5 hours later than we wanted to.

Perth to Houston TX on SQ 062 my wife and I. Flight to Moscow aborted at last minute routed to Warsaw where Singapore Airlines had no affiliation. Sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in Warsaw then escorted to airport. Once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to Paris and to Houston the next morning. Went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a SA rep. After some time told we could not take this flight. Told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. Told we were being put on a plane to Copenhagen then to Chicago and then to Houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. Inquired why we could not take flight to Paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book.

Singapore Airlines is slowly losing it on their long-haul business class compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. I used to love this seat 7 years ago when they launched it however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories.

" Frankfurt to Valencia. Flying Lufthansa - A good airline. Using anything Digital the worst experience among all airlines. Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience. For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out.

AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!,Promoter
"LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",Detractor
"I fly from Philadelphia to Phoenix I was waiting one hour in the airport then I have to wait one hour inside the plane just to take off. I lost my flight - it was very difficult to get help, every time I try to get help the answer that I got was that there was more people on same situation. I got no remedy, no help. I was stuck on the airport for 19 hrs - no one offers a hotel room and I did ask but no meals. It was caused by their own doing and they did not care. I will never take the risks to fly with Delta ever again.",Detractor
Oct 21 from New Delhi through Abu Dhabi to Washington Dulles on EY 131. It wasn't bad. There were two drawbacks. One was the long line in Abu Dhabi when transiting to India. The other is the strange rule about only one carry on. They sometimes enforce and sometimes don't but its also supposed to be under 7 kg which is unrealistic at the least. I had to put up a fight to get on the flight home with my camera and small carry on which weighed 10 kg.,Detractor

"LON-LIS-LON. Bought round trip ticket from British Airways from London Heathrow to Lisbon. Flew out on British Airways and enjoyed the excellent service. On return I lost my British Airways flight. Bought a TAP Portugal return flight from Lisbon. I was initially happy to use TAP ""main Portuguese carrier"" instead of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Easyjet. TAP Portugal is a low-cost carrier with expensive tickets and lousy service. Flight was delayed 1 hr 20 mins no excuses or proper information given to passengers. Disorganised boarding with unprofessional ladies shouting no apologies from captain or crew there was no inflight entertainment newspaper magazines or wi-fi on the flight to London. Only drinks served for the entire flight. Leg room was very poor. So the return journey had all the hallmarks of a ""no frills"" budget airline. However the ticket was purchased at a premium (almostÂ£Â£380 for the return journey in Economy class) when Ryanair and Easyjet charge Â£65. Unless things change with TAP Portugal they will go down it is only a matter of time before customers go to low-cost carriers they receive the same service TAP offered me but 5 times cheaper. I certainly wont be flying on TAP Portugal in the near future!",Detractor

" Cape Town to Los Angeles via Paris CDG. So this was the first time that I've flown Air France and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. I can't exactly say why I was expecting ""more"", but I was. Boarding was efficient and fairly prompt and we got away on schedule. After take off, a drinks service was completed, followed by dinner and then one more drinks run. I was sat at seat 40a (changed my seats at check in, I prefer a window seat). Cabin crew were nice enough (could have done with another drinks run) and the cabin was super clean. The seat was AWFULLY uncomfortable, there's something about the way it's positioned, one can't quite get ones legs straight out under the seat in front. This makes for all sorts of contorted positions throughout the flight and a charming game of leg olympics with the strange man seated in the seat next door. Connection in Paris was quick and well done, flight from Paris to LAX was torture. (Probably more down to the flight before). Service was arguably better on this flight though, and the crew - WAY friendlier. It took ages to get luggage at LAX though. All in, everything was ok. I can't really think of anything that stood out. In flight entertainment was not what one would expect from Air France, but it was ok. I would fly them again, but only because of the ease of connection from CPT to the US.",Passive
I had an excellent team of cabin crew on TK1053 to Zagreb on the 21st of August. They were really friendly and warm during the flight.

 Tampa to Vancouver via Dallas. Our first flight with AA was delayed from Tampa by almost an hour and then our connection flight from Dallas would not wait for our whole party of 6 before closing the doors by 30 seconds. Two of us were already at the gate and told American Airlines that the others in our party are running and they closed the door and yelled at me that they will call the security if I stayed there. The other 4 literally got there late because they were at the back of the plane on the primary flight and had to wait to deplane. This was the last flight out of Dallas for the day and we were told on our primary flight that because there were so many people on the primary flight with connections that the 2nd flight would most likely wait. They refuse to wait the extra 30 seconds for all of us to get there and told us they can't help us and send us to rebook at 12 midnight. Very poor customer service.,Detractor

JNB-CAI-AMS A340 and B737. We thought we were mentally prepared for Egypt Air but no. The A340 business class seats would not have been out of place in a premium economy cabin : hardly any recline no leg room video monitors in front of cabin only. B737 had better leg room video on demand but no foot rest. This means when in a reclined position legs start hurting after a while. Verdict on Egyptair : cheap but certainly not cheerful.,Detractor
" So I will never be flying with Frontier again. I don't care if their tickets are cheaper but my experience was horrible. It began when I went to the self-service station to print our boarding passes. I had one bag that needed to be checked because it was just slightly too big and when I mean slightly, I'm talking like 1-2 inches. When I selected check baggage it was $45! We then asked one of the guys in a Frontier shirt if they do anything for military personnel, he said to get in line. So we do. We asked the guy behind the computer and he said they check one bag for active duty but do nothing for those that are retired. Mind you my brother served 8 years. So not even a 20% discount or anything? That's just absolutely absurd. We paid the $45 fee and moved on. Our boarding time was 6:15pm, come 6:20 no one is getting in line and we are told by some fellow travellers that there will be a 45m delay because they need to change a tyre. 7pm comes around, no word over the intercom. 7:23pm hits and finally someone says they are still doing repairs and it will be another 30m. Well, they suck at estimating their repairs because we did not get in line to board until 8:57pm! This causes us to miss our flight from Denver back home to San Francisco and for me to have to call my boss and miss a day of work. We figured they would offer some sort of compensation for having us be delayed so long, even the pilot said normally it doesn't take that long. As we approach the man who scans our boarding passes, the group in front of us asks and he says he's not sure, but probably not. (They missed their shuttle that was going to take them somewhere in Denver.) We get into the cabin and we were told there is no WiFi, no electrical outlets, no free beverages (other than water), no free snacks, no movies, no games, no magazines, seats do not recline the trays are no bigger than a small tablet, and more. So we said to hell with it we will pay for food and alcohol because we are hungry and thirsty from waiting so long. The alcohol list was sad. The bourbon they had was disgusting, Breckenridge?, had to choke it down. The snack pack had a beef stick that was oily and gross, the cheddar cheese was this creamy texture similar to cream cheese, but it was salty and slimy, not as good, and half my crackers were broken. I took a bite of everything and gave up. 4 bourbons, 2 sodas and 2 snack packs was $30. You're welcome. The plane is one of the loudest I have been in, thankful I brought ear plugs. It's the 21st century Frontier, I can tell you, your guests expect more. Then to top this all off we go to customer service to see what our options were. We are told the next flight to SFO isn't until 10:55pm tomorrow. They offer a hotel, however, we have to check out at 10am. We asked why they can't put us in a hotel for two days they literally said, â€œwe're not gonna put you in a hotel for two days sorry.â€ We ask for a refund to purchase with a different airline. They said , â€œit won't be a full refund.â€ So you're telling me you guys fucked up and didn't follow proper pmcs, so we had to suffer a delay and now further suffer? What kind of company is this?! All in all this was a horrendous experience. I'll be paying an extra $100-$150 more on my flights to ensure I'm on a better airline next time. First time flyer with them and we won't be returning customers, nor will any of my friends or family.",Detractor

" Second time I have flown Eurowings - never again. It is a truly miserable airline. The first time I flew (Koln-Zurich) my first flight was delayed 2.5 hours, and my return flight was delayed 1.5 hours. However, that is pleasant compared to my most recent experience, a Friday night flight scheduled from Koln-Budapest. After waiting more than three hours after hour initial 6:10 departure time, we boarded the plane. It was at that point that the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that the flight had exceeded the maximum time a flight crew is allowed to be ""on"", and thus the crew could not fly us. This was intentional - the delay was publicized fairly early, and avoiding the regulation would have literally been as simple as looking at one's watch. Additionally, there were only two staff working the customer service line for several hundred passengers. Took roughly an hour and a half to move thirty people through before me - can't imagine the people in the back of the line. Once I got to the desk, my questions were ignored and I was handed a ""Customer Relations"" card with a phone number that rang for over an hour with no response. Flight was delayed until the next morning at 10:10 AM, which means that everything I booked in Budapest (a little under 200 Euros) went by the wayside without being used. Absolutely pathetic airline. Your flight will not take off on time. The staff will try to scam you (and deny the EU regulations regarding passenger rights that are a) easily available online b) on a card in the airport).

ICN-HKG last weekend for quick getaway 4/3-4/6. For ICN-HKG flight it was a bad day for OZ operations but the cabin crew held it together very well! OZ 749 down to HKG (8pm departure) that was delayed an hour due to a last minute gate change and downsizing of aircraft an A333 was swapped to an A320. The A320 was definitely older (overhead TV) and tighter pitch but for three hour flight it was no big deal. Also on board an entire Hong Kong tour group decided to switch seats to wherever they wished creating a major headache for flight attendants (and messy overhead bins). The flight attendants held it together very well! The return was on the A380 redeye (OZ 746) which was quite an experience. We selected upper deck economy seats. As there is separate boarding at HKG for each level it really felt like the upper deck was our own plane. The 2-4-2 seats were amazingly spacious with a huge high resolution seatback TV. Downstairs is 3-4-3. These seats also feature side storage bins for economy too! The new plane smell was still there. I do wish that Asiana would not offer a meal on this late flight. With a 12.40 am departure Hong Kong time the flight barely clocks in at 3 hours (and you add an hour time change) so you arrive in Korea at 5am.

The statement was, since weather is not in our control we're not obligated to pay hotel, food, transfers. Furthermore, only half the flights flying the same route to Vancouver were cancelled that day, all within an hour of each other. That one night cost me an extra $400 I didn't plan on spending.

My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on DEL-DXB-NCE-CDG-DXB-DEL between 8th and 16th December and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. The DEL-DXB and DXB-DEL flights were the most horrible that I have encountered so far. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. On our DEL-DXB flight I requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request I was rudely told by the staff that she can't give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. It was a clear sign that Emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. Our flight from CDG-DXB was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. However I have high regards for the crew flying on DXB-NCE flight on the morning of 8th December. They were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. They made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. But this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly Emirates again.

Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.,Detractor
Disappointed traveler. Travelled to Europe via Delta and experience was not good. From terrible food to constantly moving seat assignments unless we upgraded to secure seats together. Food was not very good - service from JFK to PDX was non-existent. I would not recommend this airline and will avoid in the future.,Detractor
Five of us travelled none of us got vegetarian food going to or back from Helsinki and Vilnius. We called American Airlines twice they confirmed that request for Vegetarian food was placed but when we asked for it onboard they said that they didn't have it in their system. Coming back two of us were directed to Los Angeles instead of Chicago spent 1 hr fixing that problem then they separated us to 2 different planes. We found out that instead of 1 stop in Helsinki we will have to stop in New York and there will be 6 hrs wait. So instead of regular 12 hrs trip we had 18 hrs trip and almost no food. We were all seated separately and they could not change seating even for me and my husband to sit together although there were few empty seats. My husbands seat control unit for TV light and etc. wasn't working.,Detractor
"Moscow to LHR. Flight delayed though just half an hour then bussed from Terminal D to the far side of F. Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained ""it's not our decision"". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I've had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority. Despite some positive aspects overall this was a disappointing experience.",Passive
"  Bangkok to Seoul via Singapore in business class. Checkin in BKK efficient, fast track security and immigration took less than 10 min. SQ lounge in BKK efficient. Flight comfortable with decent food. Singapore Changi lounge good, with decent food and drinks. Long flight to Seoul with new business class seat. Seat very comfortable with lots of storage space and good IFE. Food was of poor quality and quantity. This was for sure the worst ever business class meal ever. I pre-ordered the ""Signature"" lobster thermidor. It was awful. Small overbooked pieces of lobster swimming in butter on a lobster shell. Served with limb overcooked asparagus. The breakfast wasn't any better. I like SQ because of its great service, but the food served on this sector will let me think twice before booking SQ again.",Passive
"My teenage son and I flew Qantas from Sydney to Los Angeles then onto New York on the 1st January. As a special treat, I used my points for an upgrade to Business Class. The experience was very good. In the past I have flown Business with Emirates and Qantas and this flight lived up to their reputation. Business Class in the A380 has lots of room and many comforts. The service was friendly and attentive, the food excellent and the flat bed very comfortable. This was an overnight flight and we slept well. We appreciated the Qantas comfortable pyjamas but I thought it a little odd that both the men's and women's amenities bags had exactly the same contents, only the exterior of the bag was different. In the past my husband had shaving items in his, whilst I had moisturiser and hand cream. Overall, this was an excellent experience and definitely one I would recommend.",Promoter
I honestly cannot say a bad thing about my experience and my experience was exactly the opposite of many of the reviews I read. I found the Cathay Pacific staff at the airports and on board the aircraft to be friendly and eager to help. I even requested to try to get on an earlier return flight on stand by and my elite status and the staff made this happen. My seats in the Economy cabin of my B777-300ER aircraft were comfortable for my 15-hour outbound flight and my 12-hour return flight. The food was fine but if you want to eat first I suggest ordering one of the many speciality meals. And there were several snacks available in between scheduled meal times but I only knew about this by doing my research. The highlight of the trip was the seat-back on-demand entertainment (I watched a total of nine recent feature movies and several popular cable TV shows I've never seen before). And the USB charging port and the very handy small storage area just below the TV screen were also very nice to have. I wish I had these seats and amenities on every aircraft I fly on all year. Also the new International terminal at LAX is great with lots of seating with powerports at the gate. All in all it was a good experience and based upon my experience I recommend Cathay Pacific highly.,Promoter
"  Round trip flight between New York JFK and Rome with Alitalia. To our pleasant surprise both flights departed and arrived on time. (We also took two domestic flights and those too operated as per scheduled timings). Overall, the experience was disappointing. The cabin was rather warm, the flight attendants were brusque and absent for the most part, the food options limited, the IFE was rather complicated to use with a limited selection, the seat narrow, space for keeping one's personal effects was non-existent and the toilets were either untidy or lacked toilet paper. There was nothing distinctivess about the duty free offerings. The flights were smooth and the cockpit kept us apprpriately updated. The seat was comfortable with various massage features. The cabin in 1-2-1 layout was spacious and clean. In sum, it was a basic, functional product lacking any distinctiveness save for an Italian flair. The only reason we chose Alitalia was to start our holiday in Italy with a taste of Italy in the air. And we got that and was not overly impressed.",Passive
"The flight from Sydney to AUH was ok, crew pleasant and got extra drinks if requested, but I'm never doing 14 plus hours again. Seats were hard and uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Food ok but small portions and I received my special meal just once out of four meal services - not good enough. Arrival in Abu Dhabi was chaotic - why the need to go through security after getting off the flight and into transit? The queues were appalling. We'd booked Pearl Assist where they met us and fast-tracked us through lines to the lounge and took us back to the gate for the flight to Athens, really worth it. Bussed out to the plane in the searing heat for the flight to Athens, not a full flight so room to spread out. All flights near enough on time and they didn't lose our luggage!",Passive
"  I just got WOWed, and it definitely wasn't as good for me as it was for them. I'll spare you the gory details, but they have a pretty well oiled operation of kicking you off your flight if you don't have your middle name on your ticket. They'll stop you as you are dropping off your bag, hand you a card they've got at-the-ready with a handwritten number for a call center in India. They say they can't handle reservations from the airport, so call that number to fix your ticket, and wave you over to join the section of people seriously freaking out in the terminal. Your new friend in India? He'll tell you that he can't make any changes within 4 hours of a flight, so you'll need to buy a new flight the following day. He'd be happy to refund you the $30.90 airport tax on your forfeited ticket. They offered zero solutions. Pay more. Come back tomorrow with a new ticket. Sorry, not sorry. With the help of the awesome team over at United (and my credit card), I'm finally on my way to Tel Aviv. For the record, they don't care about your middle name. This was a very expensive lesson in never sacrificing quality. Never WOW.",Detractor
" Guangzhou to New York. I had a most comfortable and enjoyable flight at a price much below other comparable airlines. Business Class seat had a full reclining seat and offered privacy. The staff was very welcoming as I boarded. The plane itself was quite new and spotlessly clean. The food served was first rate and there were enough choices. If my wine or water glass was empty, I was offered a refill before I could request one. I want to especially commend the staff which took care of my cabin and made what could have been a long, tedious flight quite enjoyable. This was my first flight on China Southern but not my last!",Promoter
"  The JetBlue Airport staff after security were the worst I have experienced in all my years of travel. After security we went to our original gate, where we realized it was changed to 11. When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began. As we were walking in, my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change. It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight. It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said ""sir you cannot have your bags in front of you"". I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me, she said you need to go to the back of the plane and ""find space"". Have paid extra for the ""even more space"" seat and paying to sit in row 1, I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with ""that's $5 dollars, how will you pay?"". It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like. I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down. It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink. I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink. Being that our seats were 1C and 1D, it was literally two steps away from where they store the drinks. They were purposely avoiding getting this drink.

  Toronto to Berlin. Flight AC 1966 on the 20th of July left on time and arrived earlier. Seat comfort could have been significantly improved by increasing the recline even marginally. Outstanding inflight crew for the Premium Economy cabin: they were enthusiastic and gave you the impression that they were proud to work on this flight in their position.

Normally I fly once a year to Vilnius to visit family and find Air Baltic a cheap and reliable option. However this year flew from Tblisi-RIX and RIX to Amsterdam. Flights left promptly clean aircraft the inflight food was good but on the other hand at the price paid it would be expected. Upon arrival due to an error in Tblisi I did not have the documents however Air Baltic staff kindly got the bus to wait while I printed thus removing the stress of having to wait another half hour. Riga-Amsterdam flight also good and in fact landed early. Staff were polite and helpful throughout and were quick to sort the connections out from Riga.,Promoter

The airplane which was an Airbus A330 was ok but the seats were old and not very comfortable, however the space is really good. The inflight entertainment system had a lot of things to watch and to do, but the screen was very hard to use. I had to press really hard on the screen for it to work. The food onboard was great and it was actually hot and the cabin crew were good. I should say that for the price I paid it should be a little cheaper.

My seat did not recline which was a big let down. The food choice was limited. On my flight, the meal that they were serving were omelette and seafood porridge. I wanted the omelette but by the time meal delivery got to my seat they they had run out of omelette. The flight attendant said that she would try to see what she has and give us more food to compensate but we didn't hear from her again. The meal service took a long time. The inflight entertainment had so little choices. The screen was not very responsive. I pressed the crew call button and it took a long time for crew to respond.",Passive
"  Awful. First, the divider between the business class seats were absolutely filthy. No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat. In that seat, the entertainment system failed to work. This was a 15 hour flight that I flew business class and paid over $4000 for a ticket on. I would have rather traveled premium economy on United. The experience would have been much better.

Seating in row 20 was good for a long haul flight with AVOD which was a step up from Air Canada rouge and the options were reasonably up to date with a decent choice. Toilets were also a good size. Service was fine but food was a disgrace - it was described to me as the Asian option, presumably because it was served with rice.

Flight 764 Jan 11 2015. Montreal to Sint Maarten. Flight 765 Jan 18 2015. Sint Maarten to Montreal. We found the ground crew to be very courteous and that is where our compliments stop.

On our return voyage which departed Sint Maarten at 6.30 pm we did not see any cabin crew for 2 hours after take off. We could not get water or any beverages until halfway through the trip. I have travelled with Air Canada WestJet Thomas cook and Air Transat and have found those experiences more enjoyable. I will avoid any destination in the future if Sunwing is the carrier. It is most definitely not pleasant feeling like I am being herded like cattle in tight spaces. Surely with the money being saved on cheaper fuel today Sunwing could take out a few rows of seating In order to allow its passengers to be able to shift a little in their seat.

Schiphol to St Petersburg and return in April and May. When we arrived the previously-arranged assistance was there with a young man putting us immediately on the buggy and taking us to collect luggage and out to the station at the back. Could not have asked for better service. On the return trip passenger assistance did not want to know about us. KLM staff in Moscow messed up the luggage and told us they couldn't send it from Moscow all the way through to Brisbane so we had to find it at Schiphol with an 18-hour lay-over and manage it ourselves. One staff member took pity on us and checked our luggage in overnight. Had to beg to have use of the buggy to get to China Southern for departure back to China en route to Brisbane. Although all of this was booked from Brisbane and re-checked all along the way and we had such a good feeling about KLM we felt the attitude of most of the staff was brusque and not helpful.

"  Phuket to New York JFK via Beijing with Air China. This airline literally ruined the end of my vacation. First of all, the crew from the ticket counter to the airline stewardesses were rude. During the 13 hour flight, the food was disgusting and I was provided the equivalent of 2 dixie cups of water. When I asked for 2 more cups of water, I was told I was only allowed 1! When I asked the second time, I was told to go into the galley and get it myself. I have never been treated with such disrespect. On the way there, in my weariness from traveling 32 hours, I left my tablet in the seat pocket. When I called the airline once I got to the hotel and realized it was missing, I was told that it was not their responsibility and that I would have to deal with the Phuket airport. I called them and of course no one spoke english. Upon returning to the airport at the end of my trip, there was zero Air China customer service attendants to be found and their office was empty. To add insult to injury, while in Bejing on my 1 hour layover, the ticket attendant literally yelled at me and fellow passengers that we were 'slow' and needed to 'hurry up' to make our next flight to JFK - our plane had just arrived! Once getting to JFK, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I had to go to the Lufthansa counter to report my lost luggage becausee (surprise!) no Air China employees could be located. I was told that nothing was in the system tracking my bag and now, 4 days later, my bag is still no where to be found. I can't even file a missing bag claim with Air China because there is no customer service number and in order to file, you must mail or fax (what is this, 1980?) to a number that is provided by the local lost and found office which is unobtainable because no one answers the phone at JFK lost and found and no one returns calls.

Just returned from USA flying both ways with United. 3rd flight this year flying with United to SFO connecting to ACV (Eureka). United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,Passive
"  Sydney to San Francisco with Air New Zealand. First flew this airline for business in 2015 in Premium class and had a good experience. This year, four of us flew economy with my son and I in emergency row seats and my wife and daughter in a skycouch. Never again will we travel with Air New Zealand. The aircraft was delayed in Sydney so we missed the Auckland connection to SFO and were stuck 12 hours at Sydney which is one of the worst airports in the world. I have no argument with delaying an aircraft for safety reasons. However, as the hours ticked by and it became obvious that the reason the flight was delayed on the grounds that the aircraft was being cleaned proved false and there were technical problems, the counter staff became ruder and ruder in answering our questions. The lack of information was appalling. All we got were text messages every couple of hours. We finally arrived in Auckland the day after and got seats on the SFO bound flight for the 11th June and not the 10th as in the original flight. Neither my son or I got emergency row seats and the skycouch proved to be a joke. The seats are hard and abrasive and my wife and daughter didn't sleep a wink. A waste of an extra $700 for no discernible benefit. The airline is now quibbling about refunding the extra funds paid for the lack of an emergency row seat on the forward leg as I was given a 'preferred' seat on the flight from Auckland to SFO. This preferred seat was right up the back on the window. I am 188 cms tall and could not move without waking the persons in the middle and aisle seats and was extremely uncomfortable and did not sleep the entire flight.

CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed. Not to be repeated.,Detractor
My first time flying from Melbourne-Hong Kong on 22 Sep 13 / Hong Kong - Melbourne 4 Oct 13: Paid for the flight 7 months ahead of travel and was told I cannot select my seat until 48 Hrs before flight because it was a special fare. 48 Hrs prior to flying I checked in online hoping to select my seat. Turns out there was no option in seat selection because majority was already allocated and no one can change it - including Cathay Pacific staff. Purchasing special fares from all other airlines 7 months ahead would have given me the option to select my seat ahead of time and not leave me fretting about seats on my return flight. I can understand if this special fare was a last minute sale for seats that did not sell and very close to expiry - but 7 months ahead? My family ended up not being seated together for the return trip back to Melbourne because I was unable to check-in online. My travel agent did not know this rule existed with Cathay Pacific's special fares and was unable to help at all regardless of all the additional requests in our booking to seat us together and the choice of aisle or window seats.

Bangkok to Samui return. Flights on A319 which were both full comfy clean and on time. A tasty tray of food served at breakneck speed with little grace with one T and C. Check-in easy at Bangkok with no queue but a nightmare at Samui with long queues. Club lounge at Bangkok is a nice touch though the quality of the food and drink is lacking. Bags took 30 mins to arrive in Samui which given the size of the airport was poor. Overall an excellent experience and worth the fare which wasn't cheap!,Promoter
May 5 return from Phoenix. What's the value proposition for the customer. I still can't get an answer. We just spent 10 hours in the Phoenix spirit because of a Rouge malfunction with the plane coming from Toronto. Because it's Rouge and not Air Canada they had to wait for a Rouge plane coming from San Diego. We got this great service. Poor legroom and no inflight entertainment and at the same normal Air Canada fare. I'm a long time super elite. Westjet will be flying Toronto - Phoenix. Why wouldn't I fly that way in the future. I am so so disappointed.,Detractor

However 3 out of 4 bags were left in Abu Dhabi, one of which we thought was lost. The customer service afterwards was extremely uncaring and disgusting.

" Late evening departure out of Copenhagen for Gatwick on bank holiday Monday. We arrived at Copenhagen airport just over an hour before the flight, and were surpised to be called for the flight almost inmediately we had passed through security. Walking through the airport I realised why, however - the budget airline wing of CPH is a very long way away from the main lounge area. The gate area for the budget flights is basic but there is a small shop for snacks and drinks. Boarding into a 'pen' commenced before arrival of the incoming flight, so we were stood in a queue for quite a while, but boarding was rapid once the inbound flight had arrived. Only real negative was the plane had clearly not been cleaned on the turnaround, and there was a fair amount of rubbish inside. The aircraft was one of the older easyJet planes and was showing its age - they really could do with a refurb of the older planes in the fleet now. Once on board, the pilot announced that storms were causing major delays into Gatwick and we might have to wait some time - an hour or more - for a takeoff slot. However, 15 minutes later the pilot informed us that he had managed to pursuade Gatwick to give us an earlier slot and we were cleared for takeoff straight away - I was impressed at these efforts. In flight, the crew were as good as I've come to expect from easyJet and the pilots gave the customary route updates, which are always welcome. We landed at Gatwick 15 minutes early, which was impressive as I noted from the arrivals board that almost every other flight that evening had a 1 hour or longer delay. Imnigration was surprisingly quiet for a bank holiday. EasyJet are certainly no-frills, and you get what you pay for, but in my experience have always been punctual with excellent staff, and I will gladly continue to use them as my budget airline of choice within Europe.",Passive

My wife and I had visited Germany and had purchased some German Stollen so this is what caused the excess weight. I wanted to remove it so I could get to the 8kg limit but the lady checking me in at the gate was very rude and made me pay. I have never been treated this way on any flight with other airlines.

"On this United Airlines trip, I had 2 stops each way then final on a round trip. The flight portion from PDX to DEN, the Captain / First Officer were, but the wifi did not work, and I was needing to get work done. On my return flight, MCI to DEN, the hostesses were very rude. DEN to PDX the wifi did not work again, but they were pushing to sell Direct TV. If the wifi did not work, then why would I take a chance of swiping my credit card to attempt to watch tv? The flight was delayed from MCI to DEN due to the plane setting overnight and frost had built up on the wings. Well, if you know it's 20 degrees outside and you have a 6am flight, would you not de-ice the plane before everyone boards to prevent delays? I almost missed my flight change from DEN to PDX because the flight was delayed due to frost. When I complained at PDX on my return part of the trip, I was told ""sorry, maybe it'll be better next time"" - seriously ""maybe"" was their best answer.

QR905 delayed due to mechanical ex Melbourne, no info from QR, relied on Qantas lounger updates, probably a visit from uniformed QR staff to lounge would have been in order, finally boarded 3 hours late which meant missed connecting flight to LHR. QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average, no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds.

"We flew Birmingham to Istanbul, onto Male and the same back again. I can honestly say I have never encountered such rude, unhelpful, inattentive cabin crew and that was on all flights. Our plane had a technical fault and we had to land soon after take off on the first leg of our journey. There was a complete lack of information due to the announcement's being unintelligible. We had to ask for water as we sat on the tarmac for nearly three hours and no refreshment was forthcoming. We missed our connecting flight and found cabin crew and ground crew incredibly unhelpful. We were treated badly at the airport and had to fight to get our luggage for the 24hr delay. We needed our luggage for medical supplies. We were also charged $20 a person (11 of us) for Turkish visas even though we were only there for a night and due to no fault of our own. The Hotel was adequate for the night but again we found the staff rude and inefficient. When we eventually got to Male one of our parties suitcase was ripped and torn and my husbands luggage didn't arrive. This caused us a whole new set of problems again because of medical needs.

Throughout these 22 hours we never knew what was going on. The ground staff at Gatwick didn't know either. We never once saw a Vueling rep. A complaint is also going to British Airways as I booked the tickets through BA.com. All BA could say was that the flight was operated by Vueling. I strongly advise BA to stop selling Vueling tickets. Another complaint is going to Swissport who are contracted by Vueling as ground staff. They were rude and unhelpful.

The crew that I had dealings with were more concerned with the requests of Chinese people before the other passengers probably because they spoke little or no English. On all the trips we had problems with obtaining a wheelchair for my wife the worst incident being on our return trip when we were checking in at 9.30am we were informed that no wheelchair was available until 11am. After nearly 30 minutes of trying to communicate with staff with a poor understanding of English and asking to speak to a manager we finally obtained a wheelchair then the flight was delayed by over two hours after being told to arrive at the departure gate an hour before take off so we could enter the plane on ""priority"".

Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security â€“ even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell Â£5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow â€“ more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream â€“ off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don't (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful â€“ both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn't take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it's mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!",Promoter

"BA 138 13/5/2015. BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my first BA Flight in Club World. The experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge.

I only had one hour to reach my connecting flight in CDG (which is really the Minimum time-span you should count in when changing planes in CDG) and the Air France personell gave me detailed information on how to get to my gate the fastest way possible and made sure that I could exit the plane before the other passengers as we had a 20 minutes delay.

" We had planned a quick 4-day getaway thru Expedia with our two kids to Puerto Vallarta for spring break. The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn't help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a â€˜Hail Mary' idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn't help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we â€œno-showedâ€ they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren't any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn't give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I'm also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta. Though they partner with Aeromexico and have a help desk in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to help us!",Detractor

"Flying from Denver to Ft Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines and my plane was diverted due to fog and had to land in Tampa. Waited on the Tarmac for 4 hours before they let us get off the plane. We were stranded in Tampa with no plane to get to Ft Lauderdale even after the weather cleared. We missed our cruise that left the port at Ft Lauderdale later that day, and we received nothing from Spirit in return. Their flights are cheap but if you factor in the baggage, the leg room other airlines have, and the complementary drinks/snacks it's well worth it to pay 10$ more to fly with another airline. When problems like this occur those other airlines will reimburse you. Spirit doesn't even have a customer service number you can call to speak with a human being. I lost over $2,000 on that trip because they didn't have a plan B in case of an emergency like such. I would encourage you to choose a different airline.",Detractor
"  New York JFK to Mexico City. I have been a long time customer of AeroMexico, and overall, I am happy to recommend AeroMexico. All of their planes lean to new or recently renovated, their fares are competitive, and their service is competent. On this trip I was flying JFK-MEX-ACA. The MEX ACA route is an E190, and basically so short (45 minutes) that it is not worth reviewing. Only comment I have there is that I am not a huge fan of gate-bus-gangway flights that Aeromexico opts for for its E190s, as a result of having more planes than Terminal 2 at CdMx can handle. The flight from JFK was great, with only a few hiccups. Checking in at a Premier Clase desk is usually a speedy affair, though this time they could not give me a connecting boarding pass for the Acapulco leg until I got to the gate - they said that check in was not open for that flight - something that has never happened to me on this route before (with identical itinerary). Boarding was easy enough - though I would advise travellers to find and line up in their zone early - there tends to be a rush, and overhead space is always at a premium owing to the seemingly lax enforcement to carry-on rules. It always seems that the ""personal"" bag is the same size as the carry on. The staff was polite, and the announcements clear (and they did get my connecting boarding pass printed). So now on to the Boeing 787 and Clase Premiere, I love this plane. By far the best I have flown. The configurations differ",Promoter

I am 6'4 so when I politely asked check-in attendants if they had any leg room seats I got them both times with no hassle and no extra charge which would never happen on any U.S. airlines.

" Miami to Philadelphia. Truly honest opinion, I will never use this airline again. This was booked via my credit card points but next time, I will use more points. Countless delays, for fuel, then the ramp closed due to lightning but lightning happened 30 minutes prior to the ramp opening again. Lack of updates from the crew doesn't help. Oh and the ramp was closed due to lightning but they could fuel the plane, seriously!

The attendant that asked ignored when I stated at least twice that I also smelled something. There will not be a next time for this airline.",Detractor
" Sydney to Canberra. Amazing how QF treats it's Lifetime Gold/ concurrent OneWorld Emerald customers - with utter contempt! Arriving in Sydney after 40 hours of flying half way around the world my flight into SYD was 40 minutes late with more delays waiting on the taxiway for a gate, i.e. a total delay of about 1 hour (although not QFâ€˜s fault). It then took more than 20 minutes for priority baggage to be delivered. Upon arriving 45 minutes before departure of the connecting flight trying to check in at the transfer desk for my connecting flight I was told, after some discussions in relation to the ticket, everything was fine but that the flight had now closed 2 minutes ago and the check-in staff refused to rebook me on the next flight but told me to go CX (the delayed flight) to have the ticket reissued although the original ticket was issued by. After some marathon throughout Sydney airport, CX reissued the ticket which was then not accepted by QF. Instead, and to add insult to injury, QF charged me an additional $200 for reissuing the ticket. Upon my question if I could book a frequent flyer flight, I was then told that i could not book a flight using frequent flyer points as this was not possible on the same day (I have now found out that this was incorrect).In the past QF waived the change fee in such instances, i.e. circumstance beyond the customerâ€˜s control), but I guess profit is now more important than providing a service to premium customers.

"Traveled with British Airways ORD-LHR last month World Traveller on the way out and Club World on the return.

Fantastic service from Perth to Johannesburg in Business Class. The plane to Johannesburg appeared to be older one and not the new Airbus I thought it would be. However the flight from Johannesburg to Perth was the new airbus and what a difference that made. The cabin staff were extremely courteous and efficient both ways.

By 11pm, I was given a ticket for the next morning flight, no apology and no hotel. I was supposed to sleep in the airport. They would not even help me find a hotel, they gave me a phone number, in which I had to walk to a second customer service desk to use their phone and they couldn't even tell me a hotel close by to use. I called the phone number for hotels, but the quota for airline hotels was booked up by this time and I was left on my own to find a hotel, book it and pay for it.

It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better.

"ZRH-PVG (Shanghai) on an A343 fully booked in the ""upper classes"" (maybe as well in economy but I could not verify). Plane clean and well maintained ""full flat seats"" but my aisle seat was open in the very front thus the feet could easily slip to the right and collide with the people moving in the aisle. Window seats do not have this risk. Departure with a minimal delay arrival about 20 minutes late due to ""avoiding Russian airspace"" thus taking the Southern route over Turkmenistan Kazakstan and entering Chinese airspace West of Urumqi - this is altogether a flight time of one additional hour. Meal service consisted of a late lunch and an early breakfast almost at sunrise over Central China - both with good choices good quality - just good European business class standard but also taking Asian tastes into consideration (two of the four meal choices can be called Asian dishes). Beverage selection ok no ""high class wines"" - one Swiss white and red each plus three additional European varieties. The result is probably similar to my choices if someone would ask me to suggest five reasonable wines giving me a strict budget plus the must of choosing two Swiss ones.

We travelled Alicante-Madrid-Buenos Aires and return on Air Europa and being honest after booking we were dismayed at the poor online reviews. So it was a massive surprise to find that the cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful the flights were spot on time the connections perfect and our luggage always arrived with us. The only downside was the food which was rather insipid compared to other airlines. Let me put it this way better than Air France or Iberia.,Promoter
Travelled LHR-LXR return. Checking in each way was simple and efficient. Flights took off on time both ways. Found the seats to be comfortable with sufficient legroom for my husband who is tall. My fish meal which was salmon on the outward journey was the best I have ever had on a flight. On the return journey I had ordered a vegetarian meal regretting this the flight attendant exchanged her salmon meal for mine. My husbands meal both ways was also good. Overall I think the inflight service was admirable all attendants were pleasant and helpful.,Promoter

" I flew from Changsha to Bangkok, but my flight was delayed due to the weather conditions in Changsha. I strolled around inside the airport. There were two terminals in the Changsha Huanghua Airport AND It took me 15 minutes to walk from T1 to T2.

 Palermo to Milan. Terrible experience. One staff member at the Palermo airport in particular was incredibly rude and out of line. As soon as we got to the check in counter we were scolded by the Ryanair employee for not printing out our boarding pass (something we didn't know as this was our first time flying Ryanair). We were instantly met with a disrespectful attitude that was unprompted. We were sent to a different counter to print the boarding passes for 44 euro. Coming back to the check in counter we were met with more scolding for having bags that exceeded the weight limit. The employee was basically appalled that we had extra weight and again sent us to the other counter to pay for being overweight (205 extra euros!). We already knew before coming to the airport that we were going to have to pay a fee for the extra weight so again we were met with unprompted disrespect,Detractor

" Dusseldorf to Marrakesh. A flawless flight with Ryanair, which started at convenient and small Airport Weeze. Annoying waiting outside in the cold before boarding, but I can understand why: FR's middle name is efficiency, so it's better to have all passengers lined up in front of the plane. We had two pieces of hand luggage and were on seats 1A and 1B which was great. Miles of legroom and no-one besides us. Plane departed on time but had to make a detour because of a strike in Belgium. Therefore flight took a little over 4 hours but not the airline's fault. Nice crew which made two rounds with reasonably priced food and drinks. Inbound flight equal: on time and comfortable because of seats at the emergency seat, which is well worth the euros on a 3,5 hrs long flight. People who are complaining that FR is not clear about the obligation to print the boarding pass are wrong: they make that very clear. Not able to print? Use the app, because on almost all routes -not from Morocco though!- you can use a mobile pass. Very easy and no hassle.",Promoter

"JIA 10/23 to Chicago on American Airlines. Then Etihad on 10/23 flight EY150 Chicago to Abu Dhabi. After seeing the pictures online and flying on what seemed like a lawn dart with AA I was so excited to fly on the Etihad Airways. However that quickly ended as soon as we landed in Chicago and had to get in another line to check in. A man met you before you even went through the line and placed your bag in the carry on stand to check if it fit. After seeing him give one lady a hard time with hers since the handle grazed the side I knew we were done. Sure enough all 4 carry ons we got on fine with AA were ""overweight"" and exceeded everything else they could possibly find wrong. So $700 later we had to pay for all 4. Absolutely no care about it and the guy needed a manager to override it. She even shook her head at the ridiculous fees but still did nothing. Although they present this put together and professional staff the unfriendly crew poor meals and lack of overhead complements as we saw a few quarrels over space it was anything but. I'd much prefer my laid back friendly JetBlue or Southwest staff any day. Needless to say we plan to travel extensively while living abroad in AD but will not use Etihad again.",Passive
My wife and I flew PVG-HKG-KUL and back between the 28/9 and 6/10 on a variety of aeroplanes B744 A773 2 x A333 respectively. We found the website excellent to use (although had problems with payment) and it was great to be able to reserve seats at the time of booking. Check-in was perfectly adequate too. Sadly Cathay's planes are looking a bit ropey: the ones we had must have had an average age of about 17 years so the in-flight entertainment was poor (about six looping channels) and the whole cabin seemed tired. The cabin crew were very professional but some of the food was iffy. We found it poor that Cathay did not use a jetway to board passengers on the HKG - PVG flight. 300 people on shuttle buses is ridiculous. Overall they were alright better than the other Chinese airlines but nowhere near Malaysian Singapore or Korean airlines.,Passive

I have not taken an international flight for many years but before then I travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children (by myself). This trip I flew Sydney - Dubai - Dublin for Christmas 2014. Then returned Manchester - Dubai - Sydney in Jan 2015. I found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. I felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. I went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. It came 2 hours later. The cabin crew were sitting/drinking/eating and arguing. The meal thing surprised me as I had never been hungry on an international flight before. We were fed twice in 14 hours. Otherwise it was as you expect.,Passive

I used 2 Vueling flights yesterday between Seville-Barcelona and Barcelona-Zurich. The first flight was of a good standard as good or better than easyJet but the second leg of the flight was not what one would expect from a established serious airline. The boarding at Barcelona into a sub-contracted plane from Orbest (grupo Barcelo) was badly organized by unmotivated/poorly trained ground staff the leg room between seats was smaller that in the Seville flight the cabin staff could not cope with the overall services provided (printed prices for food/drinks were for Orbest passengers) they could not provide cold Cava and instead of published Orbest prices higher Vueling prices were charged. Flight left 15 mins late and docking gate at Zurich was at the far end of the runway (20 min walk to the exit. The whole flight was a very poor experience and poor value for money. I believe passengers should be refunded part of their original Vueling ticket cost when a sub-optimum alternative flight arrangement is provided. I shall give Vueling flights a rest for a while and will continue using easyJet which is run in a more professional manner.,Detractor

  We traveled on Air Canada Rouge from Athens to Montreal on August 18 and because the flight is over 10 hours and I am 6 foot 4 we decided to pay 200$ for 2 preferred seats which were supposed to provide more leg room. We were seated in row 27 seat A and C. When we got to our seats we noticed that there was a wall less than 3 feet from the seat providing absolutely no room for leg extension! Furthermore the seat is right next to 3 bathrooms. With almost 300 people on the plane and a 10 hour flight you can imagine the kind of traffic and odors we were subjected to. I complained to the flight attendant who told me that customers always complain about those seats being sold as preferred. Also note that as per the cabin plan supplied on the website when we booked our seats they do not show the wall or the washrooms but some normal seats in front of 27 A and C which is a gross misrepresentation of the actual seating arrangement. Bottom line is these are probably the worst seats on the entire plane but because they are exit rows Air Canada insists on selling them a preferred. It is purely and simply stealing from their customers. Bottom line is do not pay for preferred seats in row 27 and don't even sit in them for free. Air Canada should be stopped from doing this!,Detractor

"  Copenhagen to Bangalore via Doha. This time my flights were a mixed bag and somewhat disappointing, especially the sectors BLR-DOH and DOH-CPH on 09 January 2019. Both flights full, the first leg being a real flight from hell because of screaming children who wouldn't stop during the 4 hr flight. QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned. We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for.

"Downgraded from paid first class. I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8. Eventually I got a decent credit with Delta, but was pretty mad about their process as it simply makes no sense to downgrade a paid customer and enforce a 2nd paid customer to also downgrade themselves.",Detractor
" Dallas to Philadelphia. Thinking of Spirit Airlines? Like the low prices? Wonder if there's a catch? Well, there is. As so many have testified to, it's not worth it. Pay the extra money for a real airline and get where you need to if at all possible. We had a moderate rain storm in Dallas and my flight was delayed over 9 hours, with the return flight stuck in Houston for several hours. We got 5 updates of the estimated time for our flight to get to Philadelphia from Dallas. We were told 6:30, 7:30, 11:30, 12:30, and 3:30am!

" Rome to New York. Norwegian advertises use of Boeing Dreamliners but every flight I have had has been farmed out to Privilege Style Airlines that uses old decommissioned equipment from major carriers such a Singapore Airlines. When I boarded I was reassigned to a seat because the originally assigned business class seat was unusable. As it turned out the one I was assigned was unusable also. The only function it afforded was allowing one to sit upright. Nothing else was offered since all other seats were taken. I was essentially ignored over the entire flight and had to endure nearly eight hours of unrelieved discomfort and stress. To boot, I was not the only passenger so inconvenienced. When I requested a complaint form I was told the complaint had to be made to Norwegian and not Privilege Style. When I complained to Norwegian and asked for some restitution all that was offered was flight miles that wouldn't come close to even providing a one way coach trip and then with an airline I would never consider using again. Anyone flying with Norwegian should recognize they are very likely to be mislead (there is a more potent word that is a more apt but probably not allowed), ignored, dealt with unfairly and with no expectation of customer service. With Norwegian you can expect to get less than you pay for. If the attitude toward their patrons and interior equipment is any guide, one flies Norwegian at great risk. They should not be in business. Do not fly with this airline. It is cheap (in every sense of the word), but if you think you are getting a bargain, you aren't and must be prepared to regret your decision. Norwegian's prices are tempting, indeed, but not worth the risk.",Detractor

"Firstly the flight SA237 on 6 October London to Johannesburg was cancelled due to technical faults. Check in counters were not open, and each staff member gave passengers different information. Some passengers luggage was booked in, some not. Some given boarding passes for connecting flights some not. Eventually we were sent off to the Sofitel Hotel. Told to be back at 6.00am, only to find 2 SAA staff on duty. The flight departed late SA9237. Breakfast was served, then crisps but no beverages about 4pm and dinner at 7.30pm. We arrived in JHB too late for connecting flights, to be met by rude, impatient SAA ground staff at OR Tambo. No customer service here. My luggage had not even left LHR. Sent off to the Premier Hotel, which needs a serious upgrade. We arrive back at OR Tambo the Saturday morning and SAA check in counter staff did not know anything about ""extra"" connecting passengers. Then we eventually board the flight JHB to CT, SA323. We sit in the plane for 55 minutes after scheduled take off time, before the captain announces a delay due to conveyer belt in domestic terminal not working, emphasising that it is ACSA's fault not SAA. I eventually get to Cape Town on Saturday afternoon without my luggage. SAA make contact on Saturday informing me that the luggage will leave LHR on Sunday night. I called CT airport Monday and collected it Monday evening. I fly the CT-JHB-LHR return route every 6 weeks and have noticed drastic decline in customer service and also the tardy state of aircraft.

"Frankfurt to Beijing return on Air China Boeing 777. On first impressions I thought it was going to be okay - a flat bed seat but angles are strange in this cabin and no privacy. But once you start to look at things more you realise this is below standard. The seat controls on several seats did not work properly, my IFE controls out of order and staff could not get it working after resetting - they just laughed each time a new problem was found. The seat table was crooked for the meal service and bent hinges - again they laughed. Asked for 2nd glass of wine, they laughed and said it had run out! Unfortunately, the laughs were not nice, but unfriendly and sarcastic, and the only English comment they seemed to know was that we have reported faults before - so much for Air China maintenance! Food was okay, not a patch on major Asian or European carriers, but I ate it. Staff could not speak English, there was 1 German speaking but kept away from most western passengers?

No categories and no titles. If you are at the movies category, it refers to movie 1, movie 2. You only find out after you start the movie. The plane looks old and has not been updated.

The plane was clean and comfortable (it was one of the newest planes in the Alaska Airlines fleet, and our pilot half-jokingly reminded us to keep it clean as a result!), and the flight attendants were great. The inflight entertainment system worked really well with my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6), and it was great having chargers with each seat, so that I didn't drain my battery life while watching TV shows or movies during the flight.

On the flight back they switched the seats I booked 3 months earlier - sounds familiar - same excuses - again not true - after stamping my feet they gave me the seats I had already booked.

"  Customer service fail. My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund. Not good enough, and not what I would have expected from a full service airline that apparently prides itself on customer service. Thumbs down to Singapore Airlines.",Detractor
"I am totally fed up with American Airlines. AA1021 departed Las Vegas without incident and on time. The flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth is only about 2 hours. The A320 can easily fly for over 4 hours. While over Wichita Falls, the pilot announces that he is low on fuel and has to divert to Wichita Falls. Later, the pilot comes over the intercom and tries to explain that it is because of weather around Dallas. Savvy passengers on the flight check this and find there are no current delays at DFW. Why does he not have enough reserve fuel? Maybe the FAA should look into this. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight to Richmond from Dallas. American Airlines had only 2 customer service reps to process about 125 angry passengers. It was after midnight when we got our new airlines tickets for our continuing flight. Our flight was 9:30AM the next day. American Airlines offered us a hotel, but at our own expense. No food vouchers were ever offered. American Airlines left us stranded waiting for our next flight.

" Zurich to Clark via Doha. It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check.

"  Finnair defines itself the most efficient hub between Europe and North and East Asia. We understand they offer better connections and shorter flight time than Middle-East competitors. That is true. We also understand that they will offer competitive levels of comfort on board, as well as prices. This is also true. However, their ground services are well below acceptable, at least for Business Class passengers. In 4 ""priority"" check-in experiences, all of them were allowing Economy Class passengers to queue in from of them. 5 upon 6 check-in luggages were not tagged as ""priority"" and were consequently delivered later. Excepting Paris CDG, all lounges were a tragic experience. The worse being Helsinki during this last flight. No seat available, no more food available, bad quality beverages, slow wi-fi (Airport one), etc.. Last but not least: boarding experiences. As check-in, no priority was indeed applied at all in Dublin, no due guiding provided to passengers, who naturally rushed. In HEL, same issue with 4 times more pax.

Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine. Keep in mind, this is the same staff that flew from SLC to RDU, now they're serving in the return flight.

Travelling again next week and managed to get the same webfare through an appointed agent in Chiang Mai for the leg down to BKK. Also glad to see that the dreadful cold chicken burger has been binned for something more edible. Cheaper than TG and worth the extra over flying the unreliable Air Asia.,Promoter
"  Amsterdam to Rome via Zurich. How LX handled flight cancellation is unacceptable. Once the flight was cancelled, nobody seemed to care what happens to the passangers. We were left to figure things out on our own, standing in longest lines waiting for assistance. When my ticket was re-booked, it was re-booked with errors so that the other airline was not able to locate us in the system. I just kept running forth and back trying to figure out what are we supposed to do next. Nobody provided any food or drinks vouchers for passengers stranded for 7+ hours. We were re-booked without being asked about our preferred alternative arrangements. We ended up flying Alitalia which we would never have chosen to begin with, with their poorest chouce of drinks and no food which would be much appreciated after 6 wasted hours at Schiphol airport. One terrible and undeserved experience by Swiss.",Detractor
" Madrid to Paris. The worst experience I've had with a low cost airline. They saythat you can change your ticket 2hrs prior your flight, but it is impossible to contact them. I ended up having to buy a new ticket and when I explained my situation I did not get a refund back, I had to spend more money and their excuse was that they have been compliant at all times. Phone not working, it hangs up by itself when you call, ridiculous call center hours, no contact email to change flight or online chat available. The customer service is extremely bad.",Detractor

" Amarillo to Edmonton via Denver. Worst airline I've ever flown. Extremely bad on time performance. My flight from AMA to DEN was delayed for over 3 hours which would have resulted in me missing my connection in Denver. I had to reroute through Houston and ended up over 5 hours late. Every airline has delays but I have had more flight delays due to mechanical issues on United than any other airline by a large margin, both in total number and percentage. I bring an extra change of cloth when flying United because i can never trust it will get me to my destination on the same day. Only reason I still occasionally fly United is due to limited selection of airline to several smaller airports I have to fly into for work. I would never fly United for any personal trips nor would I recommend this airline to anyone else. To me, if i can't get there by another way, it is not worth going. Even for work, I am seriously considering flying into other airports up to 5 hours away on Delta and drive from there. It is that bad.",Detractor

"  Bangkok to LAX via Beijing. Flight from Beijing yesterday to LAX was unbearable. Seats were torture. Maybe I slept 2 hours out of 12. People 7"" shorter than I were equally miserable. Larger people were pacing the aisle trying to release leg cramps. Zero room to make yourself even minimally comfortable. Staff had little English and were remote. Also Air China's connecting flight from Bangkok to Beijing was delayed til 4:30 a.m. Miserable and compressed connecting time to something resembling chaos. Over and never again!!",Detractor
"  Generally excellent albeit I was avoiding the horror that is a transfer at Abu Dhabi airport. Check in was slow with only two desks open for economy passengers, a long queue ensuing. Push back was precisely on time, as it generally is at Perth - which must be among the best performing airports in the world on this measure, with a 30 minute early arrival in Abu Dhabi on an airbridge - a rarity. With the flight less than half full plenty of space to stretch out. Notwithstanding, leg room on this newish plane was ample, far better than Qatar for example, the seat comfortable enough. Excellent IFE selection - I passed the time watching the men's semi finals at the French tennis open live from Roland Garos / BBC news reporting on the election - with large high quality screens though these were not without issues namely light and distraction, I question whether it is appropriate for films with extreme violence such as The Revenant to be made available on IFE, especially when you have no choice to switch off. Crew attentive throughout with regular water runs but no recognition of my Gold status. The two special meals supplied - vegetable curries - were tasty if a little basic, no sweet. Extra plus point, however: I was provided with my choice of drink with the meal, a matter invariably 'forgotten' by crew on previous flights. Wifi was available but not used. Bags delivered within 15 minutes of leaving aircraft. In the taxi on my way home 25 minutes after the wheels touched down.",Promoter

VIE-AMM-BKK Business Class (4-8 Jan./2015). I was quite satisfied with all flights on RJ. The flight attendants were friendly responsive and committed. The food was very good and the inflight entertainment offered a great selection. The flight back from BKK to AMM was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather conditions. People complained however safety first! The delay was compensated with a Dreamliner aircraft (B787) that is quite comfortable (flat bed). Boarding in VIE was for all passengers (business and economy) at the same time. If you are not offered a welcome champagne don't mind to ask for it. It was served after the take off. If you are served left over drinks from other flights (e.g. wine) ask for a new bottle to please your in mouth entertainment. I have observed unfriendly passengers and RJ staff responded well.,Passive
" Cancun to Baltimore. Spirit gives the feeling that you are getting a really good price on a ticket. The fact of the matter is yes your trip ticket is cheaper than most airlines. But then you have to pay to sit in a poor seat. Plastic seat with only a vinyl cover for padding. Second you have to pay for every bag bigger than a purse. There is no in flight entertainment. There is like 6 or 8 seats at the front of the plane that have some padding but at a steep cost. After all is said and done, tickets are about the same as flying on Delta or American Airlines. Never again will I fly Spirit or any other airline without researching them to save money. It's just not worth it.",Detractor

As the flight leaves BKK after midnight, we chose not to take the dinner. We had a very nice breakfast before arrival, however. Service is OK but quite slow, due to the insufficient number of staff assigned to the back business cabin. All considered, a comfortable flight but some small improvements can make it better.",Passive
JFK-BRU-JFK in January 2013. Check in very quick both ways. Lufthansa Lounge at JFK was nothing to write home about however the Sunrise Lounge in BRU was very good. Seats are very comfortable and adjust to your body's sleeping position. Single seats in row 1 are best as you get the most room for your legs. IFE was pretty good. Food wise I ordered a special meal (Lacto-ovo vegetarian). Surprisingly the catering was better out of JFK. Lovely mozzarella pearl salad with tomatoes and cheese ravioli among other things plus a beautiful fruit plate and various cheeses for dessert. Standard breakfast tray with a warm croissant and yoghurt etc was simple and tasty. Catering out of BRU was disappointing. Served a vegan meal which did not suit my needs. Despite efforts to find alternatives the only thing that could be found was fruit. I was given an unopened bottle of champagne to take with me and was urged to complain which yielded 2000 miles. Service overall was pretty good. Would I recommend Brussels Airlines? Yes.,Promoter
It was a pleasant onboard experience with Etihad except for excess baggage charges. To start with the ground staff was inviting cordial and pleasant. I had to carry an excess of 9 KG of baggage for which I had to shell out around Â£235 which was a shock to me. I tried to suggest that my existing miles could be used to increase the baggage allowance but the systems did not have the capability. The manager provided me with a discount of 1KG which I was not satisfied much with. The meals served were impressive service was fine inflight entertainment largely remains the same across all airlines so not much of a takeaway here. I have read many reviews on leg space being cramped up on the BLR-LHR route but I found it comfortable based on me being 5'11.,Passive

"  My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. On my most recent trip from London to Toulouse, I booked using my Avios points. I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking. I had received one missed call with no message during working hours. Having eventually dug out the right customer services number (these were not provided on the email) I tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long I eventually gave up.",Detractor

" Our first flight to Vegas was delayed for hours. We didn't fly out of Tennessee until after 10:00 pm. We were supposed to take off at 8:45 pm. There was a loud and obnoxious woman that proceeded to get drunk and kept yelling loudly how upset she was and making vulgar comments. When we finally boarded the plane, they intended to let her fly. They ended up taken her off and she freaked out and caused more of a delay. When we were boarded I has paid a pretty penny to pick my seat, pay for my luggage, and to have priority in loading the plane. That didn't matter, everyone boarded in front of me that was not with kids or needed help. The same thing happened on my flight back from Vegas to Memphis. Priority is a way for them to get more money and not keep their endof the bargain. There needs to be more flights offered from Frontier to go back and forth from Vegas. It's one time in three days and an offer of one flight time is ridiculous. I will never fly with Frontier again nor will I share a good review.",Detractor

There were even seats with Air Canada's star alliance partner, but she would not book me with it. She said I needed to call Air Canada help center for more help. The Air Canada connection staff at LHR were the rudest. I approached British airways desk, and they checked me in for a much better connected flight with connections of only 3 hours. Inflight service was a little better. I though the inflight entertainment is okay with a good selection of movies and TV shows, but incomparable to Middle-Eastern and even, European carriers.

"  After reading reviews I thought, could it be that bad for just a short European flight? Well, I regret ever spending my well-collected miles for a flight with them. Number one problem? Communication. Departing from Amsterdam with a delay a little less than 1 hour (which is doable) because of what? We will never know. No apologies were given. The good thing is that Amsterdam airport has a good mobile app and provides a lot of information so you always know upfront that your flight is delayed and gives opportunities to adjust plans. All set, finally in the plane. After a while you would expect some kind of service, maybe a drink, a small bite. Well, this is not to be expected with Air Europa. I know it was a 'short' flight but KLM for example always offers a drink, sandwich and a muffin. I ended up paying for a can of sparkling water plus potato chips which then was being charged as separate items since the crew don't remember the package deals. After a calm flight we arrived at Madrid airport, too late of course and I had just about 30 minutes to change gates. Once at the correct gate, everybody was already in line since boarding was about to start at that hour. Nothing happened for 2 hours. No announcement, no information, nothing. Finally the boarding started after 1 crew member was being dropped off by a bus just 10 minutes before, making it look like we were all waiting 2 hours for this lady to arrive. Once in the plane, the captain actually spoke to us and informed us they were having a technical error which has been fully resolved now and we could fly safely to Barcelona. OK, all good, so why were we still stuck with toilets closed, inside the plane for another hour? Everybody was hot, thirsty, in need of a pee etc, passengers were getting angry.

I could not move my legs an inch. I have no health problems but my feet were swollen and my knee locked up after 15 hours of being literally pinned in one spot. The cherry on top was the family in front of us would glare and make rude comments every time we even tried to move our bodies.

" Baltimore to Medellin via Orlando. I am disgusted by this airlines and I will try everything in my powers to avoid flying with them again. It is basically a scam company because you think that you are getting a cheaper flight but in the end it's more expensive than other airlines. They charge you for everything. For example, I had a small brief case and a regular backpack with me. Well, the backpack cost me $65 at the gate to carry on to the plane. I also checked in a piece of luggage for $52. Well, guess what, the weight limit is only 40 pounds which is 10 pounds lighter than other airlines so I ended paying more because you'll need an extra bag which they will charge you over $50 dollars for. I heard an elderly lady on the plane complain that she just wanted a glass of water and they said that'll be $3 for a bottle. You have to pay for all beverages and food.

If the passenger in front of you reclines their seat, you are doomed to hours of discomfort. When you buy tickets on Air Canada rouge, you still pay the regular Air Canada price, so you pay for a normal seat, but get a budget airline. There is no entertainment system (eg movies).

Flew from Melbourne to HK then on to London. Back to HK from London. We have a 3 year old and found that only one of our flights was good for her.

When we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweets-both unsuitable for her. On the HK to London flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said they'd bring us something they didn't get around to it! This was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. Our attendant from London to HK was very young and maybe just inexperienced. She was quite unfriendly.

FRA-DEL-MAA return during the festive season on 787 and A320 on the domestic sector. Booked 9 months in advance to get a good price for the peak season and felt it was good value because everything was perfectly fine with the Dreamliner (seat pitch cleanliness meals staff service with a sense of humour at times good on-time performance IFE). The domestic sector was served by an older single-class A320 which was far inferior to the Dreamliner but the staff were good both ways and served hot meals during the 2 1/2 hr flight. Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight.

When I asked to fly from a closer airport they wanted to charge me more for my return flight. Their solution was to fly all night, change planes 4 times for an extra $1500! That was my first hour plus on the phone with them. I did my own research, and found Latrobe to be my nearest airport at 4.5 hours away and a return flight to Myrtle Beach 4 days later. My next hour plus no the phone with them was to argue the additional fee they wanted to charge to rebook me. Finally they extended a one time courtesy to change with no additional costs. However I still had to rent a car and pay all expenses involved with the trip with no reimbursement. My children missed extra days of school and events. This company doesn't value their clientele's time at all. You are just a dollar amount to them. The plane is dirty, seats uncomfortable, they nickel and dime you. Everything is extra including your seats. Would never recommend this airline to anyone!",Detractor
"  Paris to Oklahoma City via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Like other reviews I've read, they have failed to explain that our flight is delayed till far after the departure time which is frustrating.

"Flew easyJet from London Gatwick to Milan Malpensa for a short break with my wife. Flight departed pretty much on time, only the busy flight traffic at Gatwick holding us up. Landed in Malpensa early so made up any lost time. Flight itself was comfortable enough for a short flight. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly enough. Took our own water on board as know the score in regards food and drink on board. Return flight was same as outbound flight, in fact left bang on time and landed very early. It's worth noting that Terminal 2 at Malpensa is a bit dated but you can see improvements are being made to facilities, this will take time but they'll get there. Facilities were adequate enough and free bus to terminal 1 for train station was easy to find. Used the easyJet app on my phone for check in etc. Impressed as gives you a message when your gate us announced and all that. Works well and easy to use compared to other airline apps. Overall can thoroughly recommend easyJet from this and past experience. My wife was also impressed with her first experience.",Promoter

Flew economy London - Abu Dhabi - Male return previously always flow Emirates however this fare was Â£500 cheaper in the sale so thought we would try them. The two flights on the larger planes in and out of London were awful no leg room and as other people say when you recline your seat the base goes forward leaving you with no leg room. Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it. I wish we had spent the Â£500 more and flown Emirates. Will never fly again with Etihad.,Detractor
"I used my frequent flyer miles to purchase business class tickets from JFK to Barcelona. It was through AirBerlin. This budget airline was the best part of the experience. The American Airlines part was the worst. We had a 1 hour layover in Dusseldorf on the way back to JFK, but the flight was cancelled to our layover turned into a 9 hour layover. My mother was sick an I needed to be in New York at a scheduled time. AirBerlin asked me to call Aadvantage. When I called, the first agent jsut yelled at me. I literally have not had anybody in service speak to me since I left the USSR in 1978. The second agent after listening to my problem answered with ""And what do you want to do about it?"" and was sarcastic throughout. I thought I was in a bad dream. We got to New York 7 hours late, after spending $200 in roaming charges. I thought Delta was the worst, but American Airlines has the honor now. Do not fly American.",Detractor
"  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one. Certainly, going East-West via Dubai there's no competitor.",Promoter
"  Istanbul to New York with Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively painless considering it was at a very early hour of the morning. Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue. The wifi worked well and the IFE had a decent selection although it could have used more recent movie releases. Flight departed and arrived on time and was a good experience overall.",Passive
I travelled with SK1605 from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Zurich Airport on November 26. The aircraft on this service was a Boeing 737-700W and I travelled in SAS Plus on seat 4A. As always the cabin crew were very helpful polite and service-minded. The comfort of the seats were reasonably good and much better than the Slim Recaro seats found with many of the Star Alliance members on Intra-European routes. Since this aircraft was relatively new the cabin interior was nice and tidy. SAS Plus is marketed as Business Class but the level of service drink food and the general experience is drastically reduced compared to SAS previous Business Class. I was fortunate enough to have a free middle seat next to the other passenger which increased the comfort. The in-flight service is identical to SAS Go (previous Economy) but everything is included in the price when travelling with SAS Plus. The food consist of a choice between cold sandwiches or a salad served in a paper box and the drinks are for free. The quality of the food is acceptable but not what to expect when you travel in a class marketed as Business Class with ticket prices comparable to this class. I still hope that SAS will reintroduce the excellent Business Class the previously offered on Intra-European routes.,Passive
 MontrÃ©al to Berlin via Keflavik. The luggage did not arrive to Germany. When I contact the airline I was told that it is the responsibility of the airport to assist me in the process for the first 5 days. The airport tells me to contact the airlines.

Flew on a Boeing 777-200ER (9K-AOB). The aircraft cabin shows its age and IFE exists but is luck whether switched on or not. In my case it was on movies were in a loop system and I was so excited it was working but sadly the audio did not work. There is no point of offering good quality headsets if the IFE audio doesn't work at all. Food was of excellent quality but less portion (Ordered a vegan meal without dairy products). The cabin staff 12 of 13 were only men on this flight and service was just fair and whatever meets with minimum requirements. There is an exception of the occasional friendly crew who is nice and pleasant. Would I recommend it again? Yes! But please calculate your trips so that you fly the newer aircraft and your experience will be pleasant and enjoyable.,Passive
"  A bad experience with a big family on the flight from Cape Town to Doha that basically took over the business section, messed up the bathrooms and used the space in front of the toilets for praying - so much so, that one felt guilty to get up to use the lavatory. This family also had a child, that was screaming for nine hours. The child is not to blame - the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc. Original ticket had a layover in Doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. Qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. I was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the Business lounge in Doha but do not bet on this. Lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. Quiet zone was occupied so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. Next shorter flight in bad business seat in A320 and I could not sleep properly. Will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours.",Detractor
" Nice to Amsterdam. Although I booked a KLM flight, this particular flight was operated by Transavia -in KLM style (service etc). Everyone knows that seat pitches of Transavia planes are terrible, unless you get a seat from the exit row which I did. There were very few passengers on board and this made the flight a great chill and fun for everyone. Cabin crew was excellent, meal was a decent sandwich and drinks were served twice, KLM should move themselves to Terminal 1 at the Nice Cote d'Azur airport, they really do not fit to Terminal 2 there. I have lounge access and spent my time in there rather than the terminal waiting area, but not everyone does. I also had second thoughts about Transavia operating a KLM flight for obvious reasons. Although I enjoyed this particular flight very much, I know I would not have enjoyed this if the plane would have been packed. However, I will rate according to the specific experience, which I enjoyed a lot.",Promoter

Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them. Their service is light years ahead of United. And when you pay a premium for a Virgin seat you have real perks coming with it. Not bait and deceit.,Detractor

"  London to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Their 787 and 777s are great too but the A350 is quicker. I have used it twice to Addis this year, January it was only 6 hrs 30 mins flying time, this time 6 hrs 45 minutes. Have flown London to Addis many times on BMI. KLM, Luthansa, Emirates and the old East African Airways in the 70s. Ethiopian Airlines current service and the A350 beats them all. Even LHR Terminal 2, of which I am not fond, was smooth this time with very helpful staff at bag drop. This overnight flight to Addis is at 9pm in UK summer and 8.00pm UK winter. We rolled back in an almost full plane at 9.30 pm. The dinner served about 11 pm was great, on the box it said chicken curry but it was a lovely chicken tika masala and other items on the tray were also excellent. They serve Habesha, one of several excellent Ethiopian lagers but unfortunately do not yet do Ethiopia's first class Rift Valley wines. Arrived Addis 06.30 and visas on arrival was also extremely efficient and quick despite a queue of around 30 people. I fly London to Addis return on average three times a year and right now would not consider any other airline for it.

A380 Dallas Fort Worth to Sydney - over 16 hours in the air. Lots of room in a quiet business cabin. Disappointed that the 9pm flight did not have a dinner service but a 'supper' provided. No pre-dining drink service. Large wine list in the magazine but as others have noted - phantoms - with only 2 choices of red or white offered. Service was not at the level of other business class products on our around the world trip. The male steward was the busiest refilling water bottles throughout the flight. Overnight snacks were poor and not replenished. Stewards fitted seat padding and sleep was possible.

For some reason, their self check in / bag tag machines at CPH wouldn't scan my passport. Helpful SAS staff did direct me to check in again at one of the counters, and this was resolved. Boarding was quick and flight was right on time. On board, its the usual buy on board menu with a free coffee. The cabin crew were very personable and seemed to enjoy their work. The seats are slimline so while you might have decent legroom its not the most comfortable after a while. For the price I paid, SAS did the job for this short trip.

SYD-ICN-MAD. I always fly Korean Air. However the standards seem to be slipping a little bit and the price of fares have gone up. The food is a bit hit and miss and there is only usually one choice available. They also don't offer apple juice on flights? I've noticed the planes are starting to look a bit shabby and not matching competitor airlines. Flight from Sydney was on a very noisy and old A330 with masking tape holding some of the overhead lockers together. Seat covers tatty old purple blankets and aircraft didn't feel clean. I've also noticed the crew aren't quite as pleasant as they used to be particularly in meal service time. In the past the Cabin Manager used to monitor the service in economy but they do not do this now. Used to offer a drinks service every half hour (juices and water) between meals. However on both legs of my journey I was so dehydrated and had to ask for a glass of water. Korean also used to be tempting as they offered a free stopover in Seoul however they have changed flight schedules to avoid doing this. After the meal time the cabin lights were fully lit for 2 hours while staff tried to flog the carts of duty free. Sleeping was impossible as they no longer provide an eye mask. They also do not take good care of their frequent flyers. I was charged 100 euros for having 23 kgs instead of 20 kgs. This in spite of being a 'Morning Calm Member'. The toilets were also looking quite dirty on both legs of the journey whereas three years ago they were immaculate. They also do not welcome frequent flyers on board or offer them meals first as other airlines do. Also for a night time flight it is a safety regulation to dim the cabin lights however the cabin manager did not do this. All in all I've noticed a decline in standards in the past 3 years. Will continue to fly with them and hope they try to improve their standard so it is on par to the service they used to offer. I choose them because they are not the most glamorous but for their consistency (which seems to be declining slightly).,Passive

"Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"".

After being lied to several times by the airline with what would be a reasonable request I highly recommend taking another airline. In terms of feedback and dispute resolution. This is a take your money and run airline. Not the world class airline it reputedly used to be. I have had significantly better flights on China Southern Airlines which runs comparable routes from Australia.,Detractor
"Sydney to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways Business class seats provide lots of room and privacy, I was in 18A - one problem is that this seat is right next to toilet so if you plan on sleeping don't get this seat. I also noted that due to the size of the business class the staff were not as available as other companies. Another negative is the bus trips between the gate and plane in Abu Dhabi is terribly hot and crowded and no bus for business class - they just squeeze as many as possible in the busses. I was impressed with the diversity of the crew, the bar is great and champagne went down well. The wifi was cheap and worked.",Passive
"  Manila to Houston via Beijing. Beware Air China On the second week of a five-week visit to the Philippines, ITN travel agency informed me by email that our return flight on Sept 1 was cancelled by Air China without explanation. I was given the option to fly on Sept 2. I agreed, but never received confirmation. Since I booked through a travel agency, Air China would not let me access their website to get seat assignment, flight status, or communicate with them. So I emailed ITN almost every day the next two weeks for confirmation but they said Air China still had not resolved the problem. They gave me a phone number to call in California because Air China needed passport info, ID, etc, which I know they already had. I use my cellphone but every time I press 1 for English, I got cut off. When I used a landline to call long distance twice, I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I gave up. I finally flew to Manila from Davao province where I was staying and went to the airport at 4:00 AM to avoid traffic, and cut through a long line to an Air China counter. After a lengthy explanation, I was given confirmation and had to wait another 15 minutes to get a copy because the copier was in the fourth floor. September 2 we were finally on our way with stopover in Beijing. There, they had mechanical problems and flight to Houston was delayed four hours and we missed our connection. In Houston IAH, Air China offered no meal voucher, no hotel accommodations, or taxi fare. We were left on our own. No help at all from Air China personnel. Next day we flew to Charlotte via United Airlines, two days beyond our original schedule. The money we saved could not compensate for the stress, no sleep, and exhaustion I went through. I arrived home and was sick for a week. Definitely not worth it.",Detractor
"âŒ   I was very dissatisfied with American Airlines during my last trip. My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again. They would not even offer me restitution or a baggage refund for my inconvenience unless I showed receipts of $150.00 or more.",Detractor
LAX-ICN-LAX in B773 Prestige Class 'full flat' seat (doesn't quite feel that way though). The 2-3-2 layout shared with AF is inferior to DL's new direct access aisle config Delta is really running away from its partners in Skyteam. Flights on time in-air and lounge product fine. KE's web presence however unmitigated disaster: featureless and antiquated. Even after jumping through the needlessly many hoops to become a Skypass member web check in only produced errors.

20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.,Promoter

 Chicago to Denver. The gate attendant told passengers that purses were considered a personal item and that my carry on luggage needed to be checked. That has never happened to me before and I fly frequently on United from Denver to Chicago all the time. I got on the airline and asked the flight attendants if they changed something and told them what happened and they both stated that is was â€œpersonal preference to the gate attendantsâ€ as to what items can be brought on or not.

" Upon arrival at the airport, I went to the KLM/Air France counter as I had one piece of luggage to check in. Only one desk was open and no one was at the Sky Priority line. About 20-25 minutes later, the luggage was given and headed to the lounge (different reviews). The boarding of the flight KL1358 started 20 minutes late and we were in the sky about 10 minutes behind schedule so it was quite an efficient boarding process. My seat (1F) was very comfortable with plenty of leg room. As the Embraer 190 has a 2-2 seat configuration even in business, I had someone seated next to me. After the take-off, a dinner was served even with the short flight time. The appetizer consisted of beetroot and apple salad and smoked trout and was delicious for an airline appetizer. The main course was a chicken salad for which was also really good. The flight arrived on time and parked in the gates A, which is the standard one for KLM Connect.

Having paid Â£961 for a return flight London to Santiago de Chile I received no personal in-flight entertainment and no option to select my seat.

Spirit got me from A to B on time and without incident. In that respect they did well. I was a little miffed at the carry on policy though my average sized laptop didn't fit in any bag that met the size for a free personal item so I ended up borrowing one from a family member to avoid paying the carry on fee. I think the ultimate problem with Spirit is that while they are cheaper than the competition they still aren't cheap. If everyone got tickets for $10 round-trip as you sometimes can in Europe nobody would complain about the fees. But most people are still paying a couple hundred bucks just for the ticket and it feels like that ought to buy you something besides transportation. Spirit saved me money and ultimately carried out its job and I can't say I'd never fly them again. But given the hoops you have to jump through I'd probably want them to save me more money than they did this time before I went back.,Detractor

" Los Angeles to Rome. On the return flight from Los Angeles we traveled in Premium Economy having requested and obtained a flight upgrade. Having had the upgrade we thought we would enjoy all the privileges of this class of flight including the possibility of embarking 2 bags of 23 kg, but at the airport of LAX we learned that this was not included in the upgrade. Now, if the company offers me an upgrade (through participation in an auction) it should also specify which services the customer has access to and which are not. Needless to say, at the airport to our grievances they shrugged and the conclusion was that we were able to take two extra bags as members of the Ulisse Club. Frankly it was so many years that I did not travel Alitalia and in this circumstance I remembered why. Another flaw that I found is the bad grace of the stewardess and the bad conditions in which the toilets are left, which after so many hours and so many people who frequent them become unrealistic. Finally my seat, but it was bad luck, did not remain reclined but moved continuously upright. IT: Sul volo di ritorno da Los Angeles abbiamo viaggiato in Premium Economy avendo chiesto ed ottenuto un upgrade della classe di volo. Avendo avuto l'upgrade noi pensavamo di godere di tutti i privilegi di questa classe di volo tra cui la possibilitÃ  di imbarcare 2 bagagli da 23 Kg, invece all'aeroporto di LA abbiamo appreso che questo non era compreso nell'upgrade. Ora, se la compagnia mi offre un upgrade ( attraverso la partecipazione ad un'asta) dovrebbe anche specificare quali sono i servizi a cui il cliente ha accesso e quali no. Inutile dire che in aeroporto alle nostre rimostranze hanno fatto spallucce e la conclusione Ã¨ stata che siamo riuscite ad imbarcare due bagagli in piÃ¹ in quanto membri del Club Ulisse. Francamente erano tanti anni che non viaggiavo Alitalia ed in questa circostanza mi sono ricordata del perchÃ¨. Un'altra pecca che ho riscontrato Ã¨ la malagrazia delle hostess e le cattive condizioni in cui vengono lasciate le toilette, che dopo tante ore e tanta gente che le frequenta diventano improponibili.

"  Easily the worst airline I have flown. My flight from JFK to Johannesburg was fine. Food was airline food. Seats were uncomfortable, but I flew economy so can't complain too much. The worst was I landed in Johannesburg and customs took 2 hours. SAA only booked me for a 2 hour layover before I would have to fly to Cape Town. I also asked customs and it usually takes at least 1.5 hours to get through customs. I ran to baggage where they told me they would hold the flight for me. When I arrived at the gate, the plane was gone. After I missed my flight I went to customer service to get the next flight out, but they would not change my ticket for free. They charged me over $600 for a new ticket. Obviously I was furious when I was told this happens all the time. It's a scam. The original flight is cheaper because they know you won't make it through customs in time, then you will have to buy a new ticket at 5x the cost. To make things worse, as I was getting my bags, I got talking to a person in line, and he told me he was on my two flights and SAA changed his tickets for free. The only difference between us was our skin complexion. Since I has already bought my $600 ticket to Cape Town, it wasn't worth making a stink at that point. I figured I'd enjoy my vacation then voice my opinion. Moral of the story, do not let SAA give you a 2 hour layover if you have to go through customs.",Detractor

" The flight from Rome Fiumicino to Nice on 19 November 2017 which was scheduled to depart at 14.50 was cancelled and the customers were informed at 13.34 by email. I alrady contacted the customer service counter at the FCO airport and they suggested 2 options: offer a hotel and the next flight of Vueling which will depart the next day in the same time or offer a refund and 250Euro compensation. I chose the refund because I needed to travel on that day so I needed to book my travel tickets with different operators. The customer service staffs told me to claim for the refund on Vueling.com and I did it at FCO airport on my mobile phone. It turned out that I couldn't apply for the refund because the system said I entered the wrong details though everything was right. I queued for the query again and the staffs answered that â€œyou can't do in on your phone, you need to do it on Computer or tablet and you have 7 days so no rushâ€. I asked again that whether they are sure that it was systematic problem and they answered â€œyesâ€. On the 21 November 2017, I tried to enter all of my details in the claim again on iPad, but it turned out the same as what happened when I tried to do it on iPhone. The system didn't accept the claim because some fields of the answers are incorrect while yes again every information I filled is correct according to the detail I got on my email address regarding my booking number, my flight number and the origin and destination. Until today, 24 November 2017 , I tried to claim for my refund and compensation again on Computer, google chrome is my browser. The system did not accept the claim and 7 days almost run out.

As a Star Alliance Gold, I took the hike over to the B concourse to enjoy the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, which was surprisingly uncrowded.

On the way back I asked on board the upgrade against 800â‚¬. The seat is a real lie flat but somehow is feel a bit cheap and ""fragile"". The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess. On board the service is a bit improvised and basically depends on the individual character of the attendant: if he/she is a nice one it all be nice. On the opposite if bad will be very rude.

"My husband and I booked a last-minute trip on Spirit when we had two previously planned trips cancelled due to Noreaster snow storms. Beginning with check-in there was no rhyme or reason to the process. A Spirit Airlines employee was randomly pulling the queue elastics this way and that to create new lines. Individuals began pushing in front of others in an attempt to get to the counter. In reading other reviews it appears that there are random luggage (poundage) limits at different times and locations. Some mentioned 45 some 50 (what most of us expect). In Baltimore it was 40 pounds. An extra $105! Coming back it was $50 for the same weight. Flight times offered for our route were very inconvenient and limited. Many reviews speak of rude employees. Our ""attendants"" were not rude. They did however appear that they showed up to work in whatever they had on at the moment. I cannot state how unprofessional this operation is.

Later in the flight ""breakfast"" was served. The choice was mixed grill with chicken or omelette. The mixed grill turned out to be an amorphous yellow mass-presumably pretending to be egg, with a round coin shaped structure which was so-called chicken and four potato discs.

"I have flown with Vueling many a time, as I currently live in Spain, and I have not had much trouble with them in the past. My only complaints were that sometimes they would send me an email reminding me to check-in online and sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes the online check-in would allow me to choose seats and sometimes it wouldn't. However, my most recent journey from Paris Orly to Barcelona has made me never want to fly Vueling again. First, the flight was delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes. Then we boarded the plane, one hour behind schedule, and were told we had to disembark, without ever explaining what the delays were from. We were told our flight (originally 8pm) would leave in the morning. They just said the morning. What time? Who knows. They had some hotel rooms available at Charles De Gaulle airport and were going to bus people there, but they did not have enough rooms for everyone nor did they offer vouchers. Luckily I had a friend in Paris I could stay with but I had to pay for transportation to get there. I checked that night and the next morning to see when the flight was rescheduled to leave but there was no information. It just said to go to the airport and that the flight would leave the next day. Someone I overheard the night before said she thought the flight was rescheduled to 9am, so that was all the information I had. I arrived at the airport and found out the flight was to leave at 11AM. The only compensation I received was one sandwich at the first delay and one croissant the next morning. I'm sorry, but that is absolutely ridiculous. I don't understand how a company can be so disorganized as to not alert their passengers of the status of their flight, not the reason for the delay, nor make accommodations or compensations for the inconvenience. You may save $50 on the flight, but you could end up paying for a cab, a hotel, and one less day or work/school, etc. I understand this is not the normal experience, but the utter disorganization makes me nervous to ever travel with them again.

I have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although I am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money.

Tried to purchase seats at check-in but we were told the flight was already full and this would not be possible. Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7"" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight. This is the last time we will use this airline - it may be marginally cheaper than others but the stress and hassle caused from start to finish simply isn't worth the 'savings'.

Round-trip Toronto to Dallas Sep 29 - 30. New A319 on both segments - aircraft clean and shiny. Paid for premium seat and well worth the $80 for the round trip.

Perhaps it's the new hardware making everyone happier - cabin crew was polite and friendly on both legs in contrast to several other AA flights in recent years.,Promoter

" One way flight from Lisbon, Portugal to Frankfurt, Germany via Madrid, Spain. Flight was delayed by over an hour in Lisbon and once we boarded sat on the tarmac for 30 minutes which was blamed on ""ATC Regulations"", a term used more than once as an excuse (keeping in mind this was a relatively quiet Sunday morning/afternoon). The flight attendant at least handed out water as the cabin was extremely hot. Once we arrived into Madrid over an hour late I was relieved to see the gate for the next leg was right next door, not that it mattered as the flight was also delayed. We boarded around 30 minutes late and it was then the captain announced that yet again due to ""ATC regulations"" the flight was not allowed to take off for another one hour and fifteen minutes! He said the reason they boarded us was they hoped the situation would improve. Again, the cabin was around 40c however no water was offered as the passengers sweated it out. After 40 minutes the plane finally took off and then we watched the incredibly slow progress of the flight attendants to serve us some sort of refreshment. Despite having a glossy catalogue full of food when I asked about ordering any of it I was told these flights don't carry food as the flight was too short (at this stage I had been on the plane for over 2.5 hours with 1 hour to go). The flight landed in Frankfurt at 7pm, 1 hour and 20 minutes later than scheduled. I believe Air Europa have little or no concern for their passengers safety forcing them to sit in hot planes for extended periods of time because they have issues with their take off and landing slots at airports. I would not recommend flying with them.",Detractor

"Houston to Mumbai via Istanbul return, flying Turkish Airlines for the first time. The outbound trip to India was smooth. But on the way back it was one of the mot horrific experience I had had. We checked in on time as per the rules from Mumbai. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. We inquired with he ground staff will we get the connecting flight to Houston from Istanbul, and they said yes. So we were on the way to Istanbul. The flight arrived late. There was nobody at the gate to let us know what we should be doing as your flight connections are not there. We went through the security again and by the time we reached the gate for Houston, they had closed the gate. When inquired with the person there he said gate closed now you go and look yourself what to do. We had no clue where to go. We went inquiring all over the airport, and the people or the staff there kept us sending up and down and left and right. In the end we saw a counter and we stood in that line at least to get in touch with someone authentic to talk to. The lady did not speak proper English, but somehow we got out boarding pass done for the flight for the next day. Now the problem starts, we asked the lady for or hotel stay as we have not missed the flight due to our negligence, but it was due to the airlines mess up. She said go to the hotel counter, but to get there we had to pass through passport control and we needed visa. So we had to pay for the visa which was not acceptable to us, because by now we had lost faith in the staff and the people around. So me and wife decided to stay put at the airport, not realizing the it was snowing and we will get shivery in the night. If you are traveling by Turkish Airlines be careful in Istanbul, as the staff there is very rude, not knowledgeable, and very unprofessional. To top it all my bags did not come on the fight.

I used miles for upgrade both ways and they gave boarding pass just for first sector, I asked Purser about the amenity and as well my ticket second sector because in a previous flight I had same bad experience. They said you should do a feedback form. Waiting answer until now. They used more miles than the top limit on their system that is 75000 miles from Far East to South America, they deducted 100.000 miles. They damage my luggage on arrival.

"  Iberia Business Class: really an awful experience. We flew on a connecting business class flight from Madrid to Lisbon. Overall we were surprised to find that the aircraft was quite old - there was no entertainment system or wifi and seat space was minimal. The experience on the aircraft had nothing that would distinguish it from an economy flight as they received apparently the same food too. It really leaves some room for improvement there as the flight experience was not in any way a ""premium"" experience. The real bummer came upon arrival: our luggage apparently had been left behind in Madrid and the Iberia service staff were really terrible at speaking English so we ended up waiting at the airport without any information for 2 hours in the middle of the night. We were then promised delivery in the morning, but the luggage did not arrive until 16 hours later. That is without any apology or reimbursement. And don't even get me started on their online helpdesk - it is pretty much a waste of effort to write to them and good luck getting a straight answer out of these people. At that point I was really asking myself, why I had even bothered flying business class on Iberia, neither the inflight experience nor the following service experience are up to speed with any other airline I have recently flown on.

TAP should have mentioned somewhere the type of aircraft which, again, is totally unusual for this kind of flight. I would certainly have chosen another option would I have known.

I needed to use the restroom while we were waiting to get off, although because the toilets were out of service I was unable to use them which meant I had to wait 20 minutes to use the restroom.

Just flown GF2 LHR-BAH (Airbus 330) Seats 23A/C connecting to GF556 BAH-MCT (Airbus 320) Seats 11E/F. Both economy. After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little concerned however I must say I was very pleased with Gulf Air. We departed late from Heathrow not because of Gulf Air but the usual Heathrow being busy scenario and this meant we would be arrived in Bahrain with a very short connection time of about one hour. The A330 'KC' had been refitted with the new interior which made the cabin smart bright and airy. Seat was comfortable for the six and a half hour journey and I was only just starting to get restless as we arrived. I'm over 6' tall by the way! Cabin crew were very friendly but don't expect much in the way of offerings onboard. We got a drink just after leaving Heathrow then the next offering was two hours later and that was lunch. The food was rather good and I cleared everything! After Lunch the next your get will be just before arrival and that's just orange juice or water. I was starving by the time we arrived in Bahrain but because of the short connection time and arriving late didn't have time to buy anything so next time I would board with supplies. Note that in arrival in Bahrain it will be a bus from the aircraft to the terminal as they park the aircraft up overnight away from the terminal and you'll have to get through another security check too so don't hang about! Bags had been checked through from London so we had everything crossed that they would make it to Muscat too. Flight from BAH-MCT was hassle free the seats actually had more leg room than the flight from London weird! It's only about an hour and a half so comfort not an issue. The aircraft look nearly new so are clean and bright inside and out. You get a cold snack too which was tasty. Crew friendly and both legs and believe it or not our bags arrived too. Well done Gulf Air and fingers crossed it's as good on the way back later this week.,Promoter

" I am a fairly regular and satisfied user of KLM in Business Class, albeit normally long haul. On this occasion it was a relatively short flight from Amsterdam to Malaga with my family. Check in was speedy but no notification was given that there was an aircraft type and configuration change (already known at check-in by the way). Consequently it came as a surprise when we boarded to find that some of us had been re-assigned. One could argue that we should have checked our seat assignments at check in. My excuse is that I have never experienced an unannounced seat re-allocation in all the 20 years or so I have travelled with KLM. Advance warning of the fact would have been welcomed. Lounge was adequate. Boarding procedure reasonably adequate. Comfort factor in Business Class was no more than one can expect on European flights these days! Cabin crew friendly but lacked concentration. In a cabin of 11 passengers the Purser somehow managed to forget to serve both my wife's and my meal. These things can happen, although one can question why in such a small cabin. If we were not regulars on KLM it could have left a very poor impression of the airline to a newcomer. All in all I think it is fair to conclude that on this occasion it was a below par performance for the fare paid.",Passive

" I flew from Stuttgart to Chicago viw Warsaw in Premium Economy. Check-in in Stuttgart was acceptable, although it was very crowded. Security check was fast. Priority boarding didn't really exist. Onboard, we were seated in row 7, which usually is economy, because they offered it for Premium Economy passengers. That's bad because they wouldn't have realized us having booked Premium Eco, but we just had to remind them. Drink service was frequent, the breakfast was excellent. Flight arrived on time then. I can really recommend changing in Warsaw as the ways are really short and you can find the gates easily. On the 2nd flight, they also didn't really care about priority boarding. The Premium Economy seat is in my opinion one of the best in the world, I just have to complain that some parts were broken and that it was impossible to leave your seat if the man in front of you fully reclined his seat. Both 2 meals were excellent and the drink services were frequent. The young cabin crew was really nice and caring. But at last, I really have to mention that the IFE was really poor. Screen unresponsive and hot at all times, the selection of movies was wide but none of the movies was attracting my attention.

Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket.

Arrived at O'Hare and the was the last of what was supposed to be a positive experience for my sister. When we arrived we proceeded to our departing gate, C7. No one ever came to inform us that the flight had been delayed. I go to a customer service desk, leaving my sister to watch our carry ons. Our flight was to depart at 7:20pm, it was 7:00. By the time I reached the customer service area the line was snaked around and way down the hall way. I stood in line for 4 hours! When I get to the front I was then informed that our flight had been canceled and we would be on stand by for the next available flight to Maine. When I asked when that may be she rudely told me that it will not be tonight but tomorrow morning. When I asked her what we were supposed to do she gave me a voucher for a discount to a hotel, but we would have to be back at the airport by 4:30am to be on stand by. Why bother going to a hotel? We would only get about two hours of sleep if that. They didn't even offer blankets or pillows! When we finally were informed that we would be called for the next flight I found out that only one of us would be called. I told them that we were together and we will not be separated - that was not what I paid for! My sister was terrified that we would end up on separate flights! Acting like we were severely inconveniencing him he told us to take a seat and wait. We finally were called and boarded, but in separate seats. Needless to say, this was not a very good experience for my sister and I was beyond upset. When I called the next day to change return flights for a day later, again I was made to feel like I was being an inconvenience. The return flight was not as bad, but we were delayed at O'Hare again and we did not get to sit together - again. Never will I fly United Airlines again!",Detractor
"Our flight was late departing Sacramento so we missed our connection into Flagstaff and not one American Airlines/US Air employee were concerned. When they dumped us in Phoenix they offered no Help! When we went to baggage claim to recover our bags they told us they didn't know where they were or when they could get them, they suggested we pick them up in Flagstaff but couldn't tell us when. We had to rent a car to get to Flagstaff then return to the airport in Flagstaff a second time to get our bags from the last flight of the day which was also late. Our flight out of Flagstaff was delayed after they checked everyone through security and took our bags they informed everyone that the plane had a mechanical issue and was not able to take us to Phoenix. We again rented a car to drive to Phoenix after they booked us on another delayed flight which they failed to tell us about when they booked us on the flight. When we finally got to Phoenix we confirmed that our flight was delayed over 3 hours. Once again not a single employee cared nor have we been reimbursed any money or compensation for their screw up. This is the second time this airline did this to us.",Detractor

Bangkok-Delhi. Plane was new though no inflight entertainment which most of them have. No food or beverage unless you buy. For a flight of 4.30 hours strange thing. A cup of premixed tea cost 100 THB (INR 170.00).,Passive
Travelled from Gatwick to Havana via Madrid. No delays. Checked in online both ways and managed to get 2 seats together an aisle and a window both ways. Take your own inflight entertainment as it is almost non existent a small screen hardly visible with Spanish movies. The food is almost in edible so we took our own. You can get water anytime by walking up to the cabin rooms. A cheap alternative to the Virgin flight which is almost impossible to obtain in the school holidays unless you book a year in advance. It is also aboutÂ£Â£300 more each! Boarding was much quicker and the 2x4x2 seating makes it quite pleasant as the only person you have to disturb is your partner.,Passive
"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight. Dubai Airport looks nice, but is very badly organized, and this for a new Airport! I know Emirates can be cheap, but I prefer to have a smooth journey and not to be in hurry all the time.",Detractor
Flew BNE-ICN-LHR return in Economy class. Overall I was very impressed with this airline. Aircraft were modern comfortable and clean on all sectors. Cabin service was wonderful regular drink runs and food was tasty. Normally 3 dinner options which is a plus. Meals served with stainless steel cutlery and hot towels distributed before dinner which is fantastic. IFE had a wide selection and ICN is the best airport for transit. All flights on time and bags available promptly. I fly regularly and Korean Air is among the best in Economy class.,Promoter
Sydney to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific (CX1620. My family of 6 found the flight experience very poor in all components. The quality of food and the amount was very poor in comparison to the other airlines we have traveled on. The entertainment system often stopped working during the flight and had to be reset and the headphone outputs did not work well for 3 of my party. The 9 hr flight ended up being 10 because of delays and we were offered only a small amount of food - no coffee of tea was offered during the whole flight.

" I flew from Montreal to Phoenix via Toronto. Toronto to Phoenix there was no room for cabin luggage that were sent to luggage bay. And my checked luggage did not make it to Phoenix. The Air Canada employees in Phoenix were very reassuring. It was Monday 11:30pm and they told me that the luggage was still in Toronto and will be delivered at home tomorrow morning. On Tuesday morning, no bag was delivered and I phone to customer service : they told me the luggage was not located. On Wednesday, 48h after the lost of my luggage, I phone back to customer service and the status of luggage was still ""lost"". I took the name and number of the employee and asked to speak to his supervisor. The supervisor called me back 5 minutes later to tell me that the baggage was found in the meantime. I spent 500USD that day to replace some sporting goods in the luggage, but the supervisor gave me only 200USD of compensation given that the bag will be delivered on flight AC1837 the next day. The delivery at home could take 24h, so I said I will come to the airport. At 12pm, the status of my luggage on ""world tracker"" website was still indicating that the bag was on flight 1837 that left Toronto at 8am. I came to the airport and surprisingly the bag was not there. An employee told me that the status of the bag changed 15 minutes after landing of flight 1837 : the status is now that the bag will arrive at midnight, via flight 1835. Never trust world tracker website : even if the bag is not on the plane, the status indicates the opposite even after landing of the plane 4 hours late ! The incompetence of the employees makes this website useless. I asked explanation to the employee and he showed me on his computer that my bag was a rush bag. Why Air Canada did not tag my delayed bag as urgent (72h delay at this time) as they are supposed to do with delayed bag? I finally got my luggage on Friday at 1am after coming 12h later at the airport. On the way back there was no room for my cabin luggage, and it was sent to luggage bay. But they put the wrong name on the luggage tag and I had to quickly ask to put the right tag on my luggage unless it would be lost somewhere.",Detractor
" Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Overall, the flight was okay, but there was several problems. The wifi on the aircraft was not working, and nor was the Rouge Player. Air Canada needs to step it up when it comes to their Rouge Planes, as this may prevent people from flying with them in the future. Other than that, seat was uncomfortable, and the meal service was quite limited especially going to the back rows, where it's usually only Shawarma wraps and Soup left. To Conclude, Air Canada needs to start putting more money into Rouge as in my opinion the product is severely lacking.",Detractor
" I travel a lot and of every airline I have been with, Spirit Airlines has given me the biggest headache. Spirit deserves 0 stars. I bought a two-way flight from Dallas to Baltimore and then back, it cost around 310$ and it included my seats a check in bag, and a carry on for both my flights. Something came up, and I had to change the date of my flight back to Dallas. I had to pay an extra 200$ just to bring my flight a day back. They didn't refund my other ticket, they didn't even give me a discount or try to help me out with a better price for my ticket. I had no choice but to pay the 200$. Furthermore, the baggage price and the seating price I paid for my original two-way tickets apparently didn't work for my rescheduled ticket. I called Spirit and the lady told me since I changed my flight, I would have to pay for my bags and my seat again, and that they couldn't refund any of my money. So now I have to pay even more for my bags and a poor seat. Also, I would like to add that their service sucks, they don't got a drink cart, you have to pay for water, the seats are so small, I am 115 lbs and I can't even fit right. Overall I had a very displeasing experience. Spirit brags about being the cheapest in-America flights. I am a very patient person but like I told the Spirit lady I talked to on the phone, I am never flying with Spirit again.",Detractor
" San Francisco to Kansas City. United Airlines was terrible from the moment we stepped foot in the airport. One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we'd have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a ""No show"" since we wouldn't be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we'd still be paying for the flight but just wouldn't be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to ""fare changes"" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we'd have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, ""I need to close these now! They're full! Back up for a minute"" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, ""I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn't give it back."" He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better."" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again. Terrible customer service is an understatement.",Detractor
I got switched to Rouge on a Barbados to Toronto 6 hour flight without warning.

The lounge monitors were inaccurate and the CIP lounge staff incompetent. No information, no announcements, no service. They refused to rebook onto other airlines and failed to deal with customers properly. When we finally got on our way we arrived 34 hours late. As to the long haul flight: avoid the A330-200.

777-300. AKL-LHR. The seats are ridiculously cramped they may be OK if you are waif-like but anyone else will struggle I know that airlines cram in economy passengers so they can make money on the premium seats but Air NZ has gone too far. I felt sorry for the crew negotiating the narrow aisles and having to be polite to disgruntled passengers. The in-flight entertainment and meals were of a high standard but that doesn't make up for the physical discomfort.

At the boarding gate travelling from Dublin to Malaga and Malaga to Dublin as I do very often passengers have now started to leave their bags in a line at the boarding gate then go and take a seat. This books them a place in the queue without themselves queuing it happens in both the priority and other queue. I thought that bags were not to be left unattended anyone could leave a bag and wander off - needs to be stopped before everyone decides to put a bag down in the bag queue and then take a seat.,Promoter
"Was looking for a getaway for a few days and wanted a reasonably priced trip. The advertised prices of Spirit's flights do not take into consideration of all the extra ""a la carte"" fees. The base price seems low, but when all the fees are added, there is no savings. Paying $18 to get an assigned seat is highway robbery. And the seats are very close together with minimal leg room (and I am short). The seat backs do not recline. The flight attendants were very professional and helpful. However, the gate agent was rude to the passengers who were running late for the early 7:00 am flight. She showed no compassion for any of the passengers' woes and refused to help them to arrange for other flights. Our checked bag was given the claim check for another person, so the bag went to the wrong airport. I didn't have a change of flight, so I never thought I would need to carry my meds and other essentials, but flying Spirit made me realize that I should not assume anything. Every single item on the plane has to be purchased, mixed peanuts $3, soft drinks $3. Hopefully, Spirit will work on their customer service and not brag that they only give us the bare necessities because they're not giving us anything.",Detractor

"Out of Budapest and Warsaw Emirates have very old A330-200 planes which should have been retired years ago. In business class the AV system is old and the seats are not lie-flat and quite uncomfortable. I'm 6ft 2ins tall and my feet don't rest on the ground when I'm sitting in the seat. It's quite tough to sleep in these seats. In Dubai Emirates park the aircraft for these routes at the outer reaches of the airport, so a 20-25 minute bus ride from the terminal to the plane is normal when arriving and departing from Dubai. The last time I travelled they loaded the business class passengers on the bus after all the economy passengers had left. The ground staff then left us sitting with open doors in the bus terminal for about 15 minutes next to three other buses, all of which had their engines running while they waited for the last business passengers to arrive. Despite all of this, the onboard staff are lovely, and on this route they have apologised about the plane. Emirates seems to be operating a penny pinching service to Central Europe but advertising it on the basis that it's the same standard as the rest of the network. Overall if you can get a budget price for this route then it it may be worthwhile, but if you can avoid paying a premium to fly on these Emirates routes as you will be disappointed.",Detractor

Recently flew from Okinawa Japan to Sydney Australia round-trip (used Dragon Air to go from Hong Kong and Okinawa). One recommendation is try to avoid flying during the Chinese New Year which is very busy we flew January 19th and return flight was Feb. 4th and both flights were full. Our return flight was on a Tuesday (from Sydney to Hong Kong) and was absolutely chaotic and full. I found the Flight Attendants to be very helpful and extremely nice (compared to US Carriers). Our 2 yo daughter was screaming/crying and they were very attentive. Tried to upgrade to Economy Plus but not available. Economy is not going to be comfortable on any airline you choose (9 hr flight from Hong Kong to Sydney). Plan on little to no sleep on if in Economy with the seating. Most flights are red eyes to and from Hong Kong and Sydney. Food was ok and they do feed you no matter the time. We were annoyed as we flew back from Sydney as they fed us at 11pm we were hoping they would darken the cabin to help our daughter sleep no such luck. Inflight entertainment system was great. I would recommend Cathay Pacific but try to upgrade to Premium Economy if you can and again avoid flying 2 weeks before and after Chinese New Year if going through Hong Kong because it will be busy!,Passive

Our flight was set to board at 7.00pm and depart at 7.15, but we didn't board until 7.45. The flight to Rome was operated by an Etihad Regional, and the flight attendants were kind. A drink and authentic Italian cookies were served. We quickly deplaned and sped through the arrivals hall. Our luggage was checked-in and would be kept at the airport overnight and sent to our next leg, or so we thought. The next morning our flight left at 9.30, we went straight to security, that took us about two minutes, the terminal was practically empty. At 8.30 boarding began and we entered our A330-200, the cabin was very nice, seats wide and comfortable. There was wifi, which I didn't get, and the IFE was perfect for a 10-hour flight. During the flight they came with drinks after takeoff and some more of the cookies. An hour or two later they served lunch, which was a great meal, not in quantity but the taste made up for it. Before landing another light meal was served, it was like a pizza. Overall the quality of the onboard experience has improved with Alitalia. We arrived 20 minutes early and had a very quick experience at customs. When we went to pick up our bags, one of the two checked in didn't arrive. We proceeded to the Alitalia desk, to find a line of about 20 people who's bags also didn't arrive. They gave us a list of phone numbers, which never worked except for the Italian one, and after half hour of talking with a rather slow customer service agent over the phone, it turns out our luggage had been sent to Istanbul. After a week our bag arrived home. Overall a pleasurable experience except for the mishap at the end.",Promoter
"Flew from Copenhagen to Manchester. It's the old adage that you get what you pay for. EasyJet is a very cheap way to travel by air. And that's what you have to remember. EasyJet - by the looks of it - is shoved to the furthest part of the airports presumably for cheaper renting space. The staff seem adequately trained but a little distant and indifferent but they do get you through with little fuss. You have to permanently keep reminding yourself when travelling with EasyJet (or any other super low-cost airline) that you're flying at a fraction of the cost of other airlines and that you should always bare that in mind no matter what. There is no airs and graces with them and you'll be expected to shuffle along with the pack with almost no service or attention paid to you. That said, they are quite quick and efficient.",Passive
First time flying Toronto to Jamaica with Air Canada rouge and never again will I fly AC Rouge. I will be cancelling my Visa Aeroplan and start using Adventura. The seats were so uncomfortable I had to roll-up my husbands sweater and stuff it behind my lower back. Having to use tablets to view movies etc is a real pain. Trying to eat and view / hold your tablet is difficult. Plus the TV shows are old and movies are old as well. Low budget airline at no discounted cost.,Detractor
" Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco. Worst. Experience. Ever. From start to - and not even at our final destination yet. I'd give them zero stars if I could. Flight from Buffalo to Newark was delayed for 2 hours (understandable as I've traveled extensively in the past.) While waiting, the company tag line used on the plan to the passengers was as follows: â€œseems like its an electrical maintenance issue on Newark's part. Sorry everyone.â€ Still relatively understandable. This made us miss our 2 other connecting flights moving forward. When trying to reroute our flights once we finally got to Newark, we asked the customer service rep for the airline to put us up in a hotel in San Francisco because we'd be stuck at the airport until 8:45 am (after landing around midnight as it was the earliest flight to Santa Barbara/home.) â€œNo. It was because of weather. We don't do that if it's because of weather,â€ the customer service rep advised. At no point was the weather cited as any part of the cause for the delay! Whatever. Horrible attitudes with the employees at the gate as well. Finally we were able to get on to our re-routed flight (which, by the way, was also delayed for almost 2 hours as well.) I have a roller bag that easily fits in the overhead compartment. Before the plane was even 1/2 full, they started pulling luggage to check in. At the gate, I explained explicitly said that if I check my bag, I need to grab it from the gate itself and not have them send it directly to our final destination (Santa Barbara) or the general checked-in luggage. There was plenty of overhead space by my seat, mind you. Nope! We had to leave the gated area to the baggage carousels, where the flight attendant told us to go, and nothing. No bag. Apparently they were â€œholding itâ€ to get it on our last flight which leaves in 7 hours! I have things in there I need! And now the security checkpoint is closed so we can't even get back into a nice quiet area to find a place to sleep for even a little bit because of the sheer lack of communication, horrible customer service, and complete lack of empathy. I will never again fly with United and I hope nobody else will either.",Detractor

"Alexandria to Kuwait via Doha. My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout. I do suggest that people fly on Qatar Airways, it is much more enjoyable than Turkish Airlines for example.",Passive
"  Bangkok to London return via Abu Dhabi. I'm a platinum member with Etihad. I will say that the use of the Louis Tavern Lounge in Bangkok for premium passengers is a disgrace and I now arrive at check-in at the last possible minute because it's not worth the walk for some stale sandwiches. Bangkok to Abu Dhabi on 777 with warm welcome from cabin manager and food from the set menu or all day dining menu. Flight was on time. Food was great and we were seated in the middle section of the cabin. Abu Dhabi to London on the A380, the studio seating is fantastic and slept most of the way with breakfast served 1 hour as requested before arrival. We didn't eat after takeoff as we ate in the lounge before the flight. Fast track service meant I was out of the airport with luggage and in the chauffeur car within 30 minutes. Every time I fly Etihad my luggage is coming off the belt as I arrive. Return was more of the same with no problems and slept from London to Abu Dhabi (A380) since it was the night flight with breakfast before arrival. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok (777) was great. I had light breakfast after take off and one hour out of Bangkok had the steak sandwich. The cabin crew were poised and bathrooms clean.

"  Flew Keflavik to Boston. If you must fly with Wow Air you should keep a few things in mind. This is a no service airline. In the sense that you will not get any service unless you pay for it. Furthermore, the airline has little or no regard for such things as keeping to a schedule, responding quickly to complaints from passengers and as numerous people have pointed out. Might just have the worst customer service in the airline industry. So you better hope and pray that your luggage doesn't get lost. That you don't have a connecting flight. That you'll never have to contact WOW air for any reason at all. The product itself is basic. Actually before getting on the plane the website should be warning enough about what to expect. It's all about trying to get you to purchase add-ons. Stuff that you'd normally find included in the ticket. Airport staff seem capable enough. But once you get on the plane. Well there's no entertainment nor any wifi, so you better hope they won't implement that ban on laptops and tablets on flights to the US. There is a power outlet which hopefully will be working by the seat. But that's it. Cabin is all economy, staff will go through and sell food items and duty free, but won't bother you that much otherwise. It's bare bones no frills flying. If you can find a rock bottom price ticket, are fully flexible about your time and won't worry about luggage, then this might be an option to consider. Otherwise, simply pick another carrier.",Detractor

Flew from Johannesburg to Zurich on A340. Didn't have pyjamas in my size on board. The cabin is very dated when compared to the new Swiss First on A330. The seat was very uncomfortable fully reclined as it is not completely flat (the backrest still extended slightly outwards and the mattress cover they provide is not thick enough to iron out all irregularities). When I ordered a coffee in the morning I had to remind flight attendant again ca. 10 minutes later. The cabin was full and the one small bathroom was crowded in the morning with people changing again. I would not recommend the First class product on A340. I also wish the Swiss crew would loosen up a bit more. They come across as very uptight when compared to the Lufthansa crew who often seem happy to serve you.,Passive
"  Abu-Dhabi to Amsterdam Schiphol with a transfer in Rome FCO. I attempted to check-in with the mobile APP only to find out that I had to check in at the Airport, my boarding passes were issued within seconds at a dedicated check in counter for all premium classes which also provided a dedicated routing through security and immigration. Alitalia uses the Etihad lounge which looks very nice with a great choice of food, drinks and all other kinds of amenities. Boarding started early and was by Bus. Economy and Business passengers were transported to the aircraft in different busses. To be fair, I did not like the attitude of the Etihad ground crew, they chose to be impolite to most of the passengers. Finger snapping and shouting is unacceptable. The A330-200 has a stepped interior which gives all passengers aisle access. These seats are comfortable but my aisle seat did not offer a lot of privacy and room for the storage of personal items. On board an attentive service from a very senior all male cabin crew that offered a good choice of well-presented and tasty snacks immediately after departure and a good breakfast just before arrival. Service was quick but not rushed, allowing all passengers to sleep as long as possible. For this leg we had a non-time departure and arrival I made the transfer to concourse B (Non-Schengen) in about 20 minutes including immigration and a security check allowing me a visit in one of the Alitalia Lounges before boarding the flight to Amsterdam. The flight to Amsterdam was packed and boarding was chaotic. Many passengers did not observe the priority-boarding lane, which resulted in the fact that they were sent to the other lane as soon as they reached the counter. On board again a very attentive service, this time from 2 very senior female flight attendants who offered a breakfast with several rounds of coffee/tea/juice, quit adequate for a 120min. flight. The leg had an on-time departure and arrival. This 2nd leg had a reasonable on-time departure but arrived sharp on time in Amsterdam.",Promoter
"â Unverified | The flight was a night flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The cabin was cold throughout the whole flight. Seated in seat 70H at the rear of the plane I asked the cabin crew (both male/female) to please turn up the heating as everyone with the exception of two male western passengers had their coats on. It was freezing. Both crew members said the heating was up to 26 degrees and this has been pre-set. I exclaimed that if this was the case, why are all the passengers sitting with their coats on. I asked both of the cabin crew to ask the flight service director to pop down to see me. I was told by both that she was too busy attending to passengers in First Class. When we got off the flight in Sydney, the flight service director was saying good-bye to disembarking passengers. When I told her my plight, she proceeded to follow me up the aerobridge apologising for this oversight. She told me that no one had brought this matter to her attention. While she appeared to be very apologetic, I can honestly say that I didn't see her once coming through the cabin in economy class. People are not comfortable sitting in their seats with their coats on. I used two spare blankets to keep me warm throughout the flight. The food was below basic with the same meals served on the way up, served on the way down. The bread roll was served after the meal and not with the meal, which was a bit odd. The in-flight entertainment (IFE) was abysmal and I was told I could not use my iPhone (which was on flight mode) to listen to my music, while the Chinese passengers were using theirs. This was my second time in flying China Eastern (the last trip in 2006 on a flight from Shanghai to HK) and it will be my last. The cabin crew do not appear to have the social or cultural niceties to satisfy their customers' expectations and comfort. Another thing, we did not hear from the captain once on any of the China Eastern flight sectors. Amazing for any airline that the captains of China Eastern do not introduce themselves or give you flight updates which are left to the staff. Perhaps that's a cultural or hierarchical difference only known to them. They talk about passenger safety, they forgot to mention passenger comfort.",Detractor
" Johannesburg to Maputo. I like SAA, and they are always punctual. What I take exception to is their business class cabins on the A319 aircraft with 5 across seating, noticeably different to their A320s with only 4 across. SAA should not be selling the middle seat to ensure conformity. As the airline is struggling financially, I would have though it can't afford to alienate premium customers, but henceforth, if a flight is operated with an A319, I'll downgrade to Economy and save a small fortune. Serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly. Most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne. Net effect, the crew really struggled to effectively serve hot drinks to a full cabin, they did just about manage, but it's obvious here whoever makes the catering decisions at SAA has done so to make his/her life easier, not the crew or the passengers.",Passive

At KEF, I asked the clerk if my extra-legroom seat assignment could be moved closer to the front. Not only did she move me 5 rows from the door, but she came around the counter and put a tag on my too big and way overweight carry-on bag that said - You Shall Pass. I also had two other large shopping bags which everyone ignored and went into the overhead easily. There were three passport and BP checks, which didn't really have to do with WOW. Getting to boarding reminded me of the Tokyo subway at rush hour. Then buses across the tarmac, schlepping my stuff up the stairway. Flight crew were very helpful. Extra legroom is always worth the dough on a nine hour flight. The plane was a spotless A333 with no bells and whistles. No chargers, no wi-fi, no screens, but the seats themselves were cushy, a happy trade-off for me. One neighbor volunteered he preferred no screens, he read a 400 page book.

I took JetBlue twice within the last 10 days. The first from Chicago to Boston the plane left more than an hour late than scheduled due to machinery problems and midway during the flight it was revealed to us that we were landing in Buffalo NY because the problems apparently had not been fixed. I ended up getting home more than 5 hours later than scheduled that night. I was issued a travel bank credit so I used this to take another JetBlue flight from LA to Boston a few days later thinking that the same thing probably cannot happen again. Apparently I was wrong. The flight was late again for another hour due to machinery problems. While we were waiting on the tarmac I asked my husband to ask for a blanket as it felt a bit cold and the flight attendant wanted to charge us $5 for the blanket. I can't help but think that: you've wasted a total of 5-10 hours of our time in the past few days and you're asking us for $5? This is the last time I will take JetBlue unless they are significantly cheaper or have a much more convenient time than other options (Which I don't think they do).,Detractor

 London to Perth via Singapore. I was expecting so much more. Not just the reviews but the additional cost of premium. The first leg to Singapore was poor. The air crew are fully engaged with economy and consequently are not seen. The second leg was so much better due to the air crews attitude and attention. Ironically the second leg was economy. Certainly on the first leg premium on the 777-300 I do not feel the seat justifies the significant increase in cost. The majority of passengers around me had been upgraded from economy. The economy seat on the second leg near the exit was just as comfortable so unless you are flying business I would suggest econony seat near the exit.

"  Never will we fly with Delta Air Lines again. We travelled from Heathrow to Atlanta on 28/12/2016 and our flight was delayed by two hours which meant that we missed our connecting flight to the Dominican Republic. We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation.

We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States.

I just want to mention some main points: 1) The crews are not really warm nor patient, which happens to almost all Air China flights I have taken. I am not sure whether it's because majority of the passengers are Chinese. I am not going comment on the behavior of the passengers themselves, as a service provider, the least you have to do is smile and be courteous. On the other hand, I can't say all Etihad crews are excellent, but I have encountered some who are really sincere and hospitable. 2) The entertainment system is really outdated, the control is not sensible any more and the movies are really lame. On the contrary, Etihad has a great selection of movies and easy to use system. Besides, it has considerably provided each passenger a small pouch with an eye mask, a toothbrush with toothpaste, a pair of ear plugs plus a pair of socks.

"  We had booked a return flight with Emirates, from Glasgow to Zanzibar via Dubai on 27th February and returning on 7th March. After confirming our booking, we found that the 6 hour leg from Dubai to Zanzibar is operated by FlyDubai, which turns out to be a low cost (but not particularly cheap) airline. The Emirates flights to and from Glasgow to Dubai on a 777-300 were excellent in all respects but we can honestly say that in all our years of travelling, the FlyDubai flights in a Boeing 737-800MAX were probably the worst we have ever taken. By booking with Emirates, we not unreasonably expected to get at least a roughly comparable standard of service and amenities. We believe that Emirates should make it clearer when booking that an associated connecting flight is operated by a budget airline, and a poor one at that. There were so many things wrong that it's difficult to know where to start but here goes: The seats were really very cramped, with a nominal pitch of 30â€ but I suspect that in reality it's a bit less than this. Furthermore, the seats were quite hard and our backsides started to suffer after a couple of hours. They've tried to cram in as many passengers as possible and whilst this may be just bearable for short haul flights, it's a disgrace to use this configuration for what was a long haul flight. It was obvious that many passengers, and more especially the taller ones, were really suffering. The aisle was very narrow, and passengers in aisle seats were being constantly bumped into while trying to sleep. The cabin on both the outbound and return flights was terribly stuffy and airless. Air con was either not working properly, or not set up correctly. People were asking for water but had to pay for it! Absolutely disgraceful! As we were on an Emirates ticket, we were entitled to complimentary meals, but other passengers had to pay. The meals were truly awful and pretty much inedible. In flight entertainment is available but has to be paid for, even for those on an Emirates ticket. FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 which entails a painfully slow 40 minute bus transfer from Terminal 3 â€“ this is pretty nail-biting if you have a tight connection, as we did. All in all, a horrible experience that we never wish to repeat and we can categorically state that we will never use FlyDubai again, and nor will we book with Emirates if they use them for connecting flights. There are better alternatives.",Detractor

Fastest deplaning ever in Toronto, as connecting passengers we were fast tracked through immigration and customs and so had time for a nice lunch prior to our on time departure to Montreal. This short flight was operated by Air Canada, and what a difference - charm, courtesy and even a drink and snack. Our trip home was a doddle, effortless check in at Montreal, very pleasant flight with Air Canada, easy on time connection to Air Canada rouge in Toronto. A full but quiet flight home to Dublin marred only by a truly vile diner (and a charge of 6 dollars for a small bottle of wine). Air Canada rouge personnel glum and would certainly benefit from instruction from Air Canada personnel. Overall and for the price paid, we certainly got value for money. Would probably prefer to travel with the full fare Air Canada in future. ***NO NAME",Promoter
My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.,Detractor
Traveled from London to Guangzhou CZ304 Sat 2nd November in Business Class. Been many times with China Southern and have to say both out and back the service was superb. Brand new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent and very comfortable indeed. I normally complain that the girls on China Southern are not very good but this time they were excellent. The food was not too bad although it is not their best point but they are trying. Just one complaint the films going out are the same coming back. This airline represents excellent value and because it is a direct flight to Guangzhou saves hours going via the Middle East. Definitely improving the service on board nice pleasant staff who couldn't do enough.,Promoter
" What Spirit offer in low fares, their policies and customer service, is well within reason. Atlantic City to Tampa return. Both flights were great. I had heard negative things about Spirit, so was very interested and keen to fly with them, to enable me to have my own experience and form my own opinion. The price and flights were much better than other options, so I decided to fly with Spirit. Everything turned out to be completely smooth in both directions. Boarding was very fast on both flights, and service was reasonable (with cheerful staff). I had no problem bringing my backpack on board, as a free carry on. I knew Spirit is an affordable budget airline and not to expect free food or drinks, but the prices for purchasing items were reasonable. My flights left and arrived ahead of time. Leg room was reasonable and I was comfortable, it was worth being on a budget flight and preferred what little discomforts there were? There were none, considering the excellent fares. The aircraft was clean neat and tidy and the air crew and ground staff were all in good Spirit, pleasant and friendly. Definitely a value for money flight. I received everything I wanted and expected, a pleasant flight without any issues or problems. Only concern was my carbon fibre suitcase received unwarranted minor scratches. Next time I will protect my luggage with an outer cover. I would definitely fly with them again.",Promoter
"I used ANA last Nov. 2015, it was the best flight I ever had. From the plane with wide spacious leg room, the most tasteful meal, and the best service of Cabin Crew. It's a long flight but the crew still manage to smile and rendered a good service. From check in counter in San Jose, you can see how courteous and respectful staff they have and to the counter staff in Transfer Desk of Narita so polite and respective manner when you inquire or ask help.

JFK-HKG 17 Nov 2013. Premium Economy on 777-300ER featured not only more legroom and more deeply reclining seats but a wider arm rest between seats resulting in a sense of not crowding the passenger next to me (or vice versa!). Odd that dinner would be served at approximately 2.00 am when all I wanted to do was sleep. All-in-all a pleasant if lengthy trip and because of a small subsection of the cabin reserved for this class it provided a feeling of relative seclusion. Very attentive staff. Avoid bulkhead seats as people walking down the left aisle using restroom on right side of aircraft must walk across the outstretched legs of passenger reclining there.,Passive
"  Ft Lauderdale to Cali. We are senior Canadians who have travelled a lot internationally so do have some experience with airlines. We found this airline especially good in terms of comfort, smoothness, adherence to schedule and attentiveness of staff. The price was very, very reasonable. In fact we have flown this four hour route probably 10 times now over the years and have never found such a deal. It left precisely on time and we arrived 15 minutes early. The plane itself was very new, very clean and not overcrowded. As mentioned in flight information, no meal was served but anticipating this in advance we were able to bring sufficient carry on food to meet our needs. The luggage taken was minimal, which most seasoned travellers do, so there was no extra charge. The ride itself was very pleasant and without much turbulence. Our take-off and landing were both excellent and we cannot say enough about the courtesy of the staff. They were attentive and very cheerful and this was late in the night. We did request a beverage along the way and it was very reasonably priced. After booking this flight, we did look at reviews and were somewhat apprehensive due to the negativity. Upon closer examination we noted that many were made by individuals who were travelling within the United States itself. It seemed that perhaps many had unrealistic expectations and/or had not travelled that much internationally so had little basis of comparison. We would certainly fly with Spirit Airlines again. Great value for the money.",Promoter
" My flight was originally at 11 pm on Thursday. They notified us extremely late that our flight is canceled. They said this was out of their control and people that booked with travel agents got notified, but some people that did didn't get notified. When we called to rebook, they put us on hold for a long time and then hung up. When pressing the option to rebook, they hung up on us. At the airport, we were going to rebook but they assured us that our flight would leave the next day at 3:30 PM and that everyone would be automatically rebooked, so we went back home and hoped for the best. The next day we found out that the 3:30 flight was canceled (only through a website, they did not notify us directly). We went to the airport in hopes of getting another flight. When we came they assured us that our flight would be that day at 11 PM and that the airplane was on its way. (Turns out the airplane didn't leave London) Although we were pessimistic, we stayed, again hoping for the best. At around 6 Pm we found out that they had lied to us. Most likely to keep us relatively calm, they had told us that we would be guaranteed spots on the 11 PM flight but as we found out, there was no space for us and they knew that all along. They kept us waiting almost a whole day for something they knew would not happen. The manager was hiding in his office, except for the time that he assured all of us that we are guaranteed a spot on the flight, while the airline brings random workers that don't even work for them to come and answer the frantic people's questions. Anyway, they are now trying to rebook around 450 people onto a delta flight the next day at 9 PM, in the middle of this after only getting through around 5 people, they left, saying that they don't have the authority to book us with another airline. They have come back but nothing is happening. We have now been waiting for a day and a half, and it will become more than two days. We are losing all of our time in London, we will only be there for about half a day. We have lost a lot of money, starting with our air BNB bills and our flight, etc. We don't even know if we're making it anywhere and if we will even go on vacation. We have gone back and forth 4 or 5 times. This is my first and last time taking Norwegian airlines. Never again am I putting myself through such stress.",Detractor
 Kuwait to Kathmandu via Sharjah. The staff in boarding pass counter were rude and didn't issue my pass until it was 45 min for take off which mean I have to run. This much was fine but at the end of flight in Kathmandu when I collect my luggage i found it was damage and same time I fill up the form for the claim and after a week I got a reply saying I'll be compensated half of the amount of the luggage. Then never hear from the baggage department. So all I can suggest is never use this airline. We pay for the flight which means we trust them for our bags and everything but all I can say is they doesn't care. And I'm sure they really don't care,Detractor

The bar counter at the back of the Business cabin was left depleted and dirty, not once in over 4 hours did the crew check on passengers and enquire about drinks. Only during the last hour or so did they reappear to offer, unenthusiastically, drinks or snacks. The food was good, but with a service expedited as quickly as possible (the cabin was full or almost). The wines have recently taken a dive for the worse.",Passive
CX548 HKG-HND Premium Economy. This is a 777-300ER. I like this aircraft because it has a separate washroom in the Premium Economy Cabin.

I was expecting something awful but Pegasus Airlines turned out to be a very nice experience. I pre booked seat 4A for a few euros and it was a comfortable leather seat with plenty of leg room for me (5ft 11). I also pre booked a chicken dinner which was served shortly after take off and as far as airline food goes it was superb. The crew were polite and the flight departed on time and landed early. This was a scheduled flight and I think a lot of people fly package holidays so the tour operator decides seat pitch and catering.

"Difficult to fault, although I felt the cabin crew on the Delhi - Dubai (777-300ER) flight had an edge to them, attentive as soon as you board, called you by your name, introduce themselves and have a chat. Very welcoming. The upper deck of the A380 has so many cabin crew, they say hello as your go to your seat but then stand around for a long time before fully engaging, they seem to engage with each other more than the passengers. This is only an observation, but I have noticed it on a previous flight as well. Catering was very good from Delhi - Dubai, very good Indian meal, and Arab Mezze, lots of drinks offered and a beautiful Mango Mousse for desert. Cannot fault ICE the Emirates in flight entertainment system, its got an absolutely monster choice of movies / albums, more than enough, it took me ages to choose my movie as the selection was so good. Catering from Dubai to London, was OK, some sandwiches after take off which was early morning, were not particularly fresh, where as if you go back to the bar area the food there looked a lot more enticing (and fresh). I asked to borrow a pen, 5 times from the cabin crew to fill out my breakfast form, eventually had to go back to the bar to borrow one from the bar tender. Breakfast was good, and served just before landing at Gatwick. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft and just seems to float, little turbulence was felt, and the cabin / seats were superb. Strangely given the choice I would take the Boeing 777-300ER purely because the crew seem to be more on the ball, but overall the Emirates experience was very very good. Landing at Gatwick means quite a walk over the large bridge to get to the main terminal, assume due to the assigned parking areas for the A380. Bag was lost on arrival, no fault of Emirates, someone walked off with it by mistake, but Emirates were very helpful contacting the passenger who was on the M25 and had to bring my bag back - unbelievable.",Promoter

CX828 HKG-YYZ business class seat 16K. Bravo CX. Puts the US carriers to shame. Got onboard and realized I was seated adjacent to a mother and her 3 young daughters in the second small cabin of business class and imagined there was going to be a lot of family chit-chatting so asked the purser if there was a window seat in the first larger business cabin available. She found a family member of a CX staff travelling on a pass and asked her to switch seats with me. I then used the lavatory and returned to my seat with a wad of tissue. This was noted by a flight attendant who arrived at my seat with an entire box of tissue for my use throughout the flight. That was thoughtful. Food was excellent particularly the hamburger from the mid-flight snack menu. I asked to have the first meal served 'express' with everything (appetizer entree dessert etc) on the tray delivered asap after take-off as I was really tired and wanted to just eat fast and sleep. This was no problem and done as requested. Seat comfort good - lots of storage space. Selection of movies and very good. Flight on time. Flight attendants couldn't have been nicer - polite obliging.

MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,Passive

"Boston to Bristol via Keflavik. WOW is a horrendous airline and a disgrace to Iceland and the airline industry. I arrived at Boston airport on 19/6/16 and was told at the WOW check-in desk that my flight to Keflavik would be delayed. I was given 100% assurance that my connecting flight to Bristol would not be affected. This was not true, my connecting flight was affected and I missed it. I'm pretty sure they knew this but lied to us all so that they wouldn't be liable for reimbursements. Not a good start! We got stranded at KEF of course, and were given no information and no flight options other than being told to go to a hotel and wait. WOW does not employ anyone directly on the ground at KEF (their home airport) which means there's literally nobody to talk to there. I found this completely bizarre for an airline but it makes sense as they try to avoid assisting their passengers at all costs. While stranded in Iceland we received zero information about anything. My many emails, tweets and phone calls to WOW were ignored and nobody from the airline got in touch with us until a note mysteriously appeared in the Soviet-style 'hotel' saying that we would be bused back to KEF early the next morning. When we arrived at the check-in desk the next day nobody knew who we were and nobody had a record of our bookings! I originally paid to fly to Bristol but would have taken any flight to the UK at that point. However, WOW staff refused to book me on their flight to London Gatwick (or any other flight). Because WOW refused to get me on a flight to the UK, I was forced to pay for an Icelandair flight. However and bizarrely, 30mins before the WOW flight to Gatwick departed, the staff suddenly agreed to put me on the flight and I eventually flew to Gatwick. I have no idea why it required 2hrs of persuasion and for me to book another flight before this happened - it should have happened as soon as I arrived at the airport. The experience was crazy and stressful. I arrived in Gatwick and I was required to buy a train ticket to take me to my final destination (Bristol). WOW air is a shambolic company that does not care one bit about its customers. If you want to get to your destination on time, with your luggage, and without feeling ripped off and disgusted at this quick-buck company, I strongly suggest flying with someone else.",Detractor
"Quite simply next time we fly, and where possible, we shall use any other airline (with one exception being South African Airways) rather than British Airways. Flew from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. The seating in business on the A380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate. The staff were just about acceptable, but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job. Oh, and my TV packed up and froze, so I was unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey. The Qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the A380.

"  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment. I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11Â½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn't the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR.

At the end of the flight in Beijing they offered us a piece of paper that would supposedly compensate us for the delay.

When we did, they just told us to call their customer service line, which we did, and never heard back from them. So we contacted our travel agent, who then contacted Air China, and had this to say about them: ""I called the reservation and they don't take care of the refund.

" Edmonton to Zihuatanejo. Leaving Edmonton, check in was unorganized, understaffed, and ridiculously slow. Boarding was late, probably due to terrible check in as well.

I understand that mistakes can be made (running out of fuel) but to have nobody helping or assisting customers on a mistake made by your Airline is totally unacceptable.

 Doha to Paris in August 2017. No amenity kit in economy class. The flight attendants told me that amenities are only given on more than 9 hr duration flights and not on a 7 hr daytime flight. Nevertheless in most of the flight the attendants pulled down the window shade. A pitiful breakfast was served and quality and quantity was miserable. Entertainment was average. A very dry snack was given before landing in Paris.,Passive
  China Eastern website is net easy to navigate but I was finally able to choose a seat after spending some time to search. Check in at Los Angeles for my flight to Seoul via Shanghai was quick and professional. Agents at the gate were very business like. The B777 appeared very new and was clean. The business like attitude continued with the flight attendants throughout the flight - courteous but never warm. The plane was only about 60% full so there was a lot of room to stretch out. Food and IFE were adequate and not unlike other airlines I have flown. PVG is a big airport and the CE staff were again business like. I did not interact with the gate agent for my Seoul flight so nothing to say there. Flight to Seoul was 100% full. Left a little late but arrived on time. Flight attendants were methodical and never smiled. At times they could seem a little rude. Since I don't speak Chinese I could never understand them but they seemed a little curt to most of the passengers. Overall I got to where I wanted to go on a clean plane and generally on-time for an amazing price. Food and IFE were reasonable and my bags got arrived when I arrived.,Passive
"  Flew Kochi to London Heathrow via Delhi. I have to admit Air India exceeded my expectations, both sectors was on time and flown on B787 dreamliner which was clean and legroom was better than QR and EK. Food was good and IFE was acceptable. The only downside I felt was the attitude of some of the flight attendants, there was no smile and looked as if they were not interested in the job. Couple of times the food cart hit my seat hard from behind and there was not even a reaction let alone an apology. Overall I enjoyed the flight and would recommend Air India.",Promoter
" Johannesburg to Perth with South African Airways. The flight attendants were very friendly. They have a good sense of humor and are fun to talk to. The only thing was that they were barely seen after dinner and we had no snack service. The food was on point. The IFE had a surprisingly good selection of movies. The seats have really been worn down and look very tired. Besides those few problems, the flight was perfect.",Passive
" The flight from New York City to San Juan in my opinion was generally good. No delays, good service by the flight attendants and a reasonable price one way 98 USD. The problem was the overpricing of the baggage. PR got devastated by a monster hurricane Maria and my family needed a generator and my sister did the same route and same airline and payed 25 dollars for the same generator. I left 2 weeks later (October 29th 2017) and paid 70 dollars for it. In general Delta is fine except the baggage overcharging in a emergency situation in PR.",Passive

You cannot even move in the toilets unless all your clothes wipe the walls, toilet bowl and the bin stowage. As Flydubai's toilets always have wet floors and shelfs, they must enlarge the toilets and ensure that their crew maintain the cleanliness of the toilets. The internet did not work and was rejecting my payment method which I used every time and there was not any actual reason for their system to reject my payment other than an unacceptable error. There was not enterainment system installed. Expensive tickets with poor facilities.",Detractor
I do not travel often but the experience I had with Spirit leaves little to be desired. The plane that was to be mine was delayed several hours coming from Denver. When we finally boarded we sat on the tarmac for 1 hour with no AC. The pilot came on and said that we had to return to the gate because we would not make curfew flying into LaGuardia. This was a Wednesday and we were told that the next available flight would be on Saturday. I needed to be in NYC by Thursday! Unacceptable. No hotel vouchers to be had. The money I spent for the shuttle to the airport was non-refundable. There were only 2 agents at the counter to deal with all these people who had nowhere to go. Needless to say they were not very accommodating they were not able to deal well with the situation. What a disappointing experience flying with Spirit!,Detractor
 Delhi to Bangalore. I was traveling with someone who was visually impaired. And when I reached the check in the girl on the other side was helpful to provide us with assistance. She was excellent.

"Recently I flew on Qatar Airways A320 and then a Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Washington via Doha. The cabin crew were attentive at all times and had a smile on their face. If they did not have the desired option of food they politely replied that they did not have and recommended something else suitable for the passenger. IFE System was the new Oryx which had every movie one would like. They even featured cartoons and TV serials for kids in all languages with subtitles. The food was great, they offered lamb biryani as well as sandwich with vegan or chicken filling. The seats were comfortable which helped me sleep for some time.

" Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.",Passive
"Chicago to London Heathrow with United Airlines. First of all, getting on the aircraft was very simple and quick. There were surprisingly few people on the flight and after we went to the seats we were assigned to, we were allowed to move and spread out. Most of us were able to have an entire row of two to three seats to ourselves which greatly enhanced the comfort of such a long international flight. We were warmly welcomed and I could see the safety demonstration well. The food and drink service was efficient and often. The assortment of drinks was welcomed, and so was the snack. The dinner, as expected in economy class on an airplane was not the best, but it did include gelato which was a treat. They provided newspapers and magazines as well. However I could never figure out the entertainment system, nor the wifi within the airplane. The darkening of the cabin was timely, the restrooms were very clean and actually relatively spacious and well lit. The staff was curtious. As well as they were helpful with special assistance when needed.",Promoter
"I have flown so much, especially long haul, that I thought I had seen everything, However, to have a fellow passenger swear at the flight attendant (Brisbane - Hong Kong sector) because (wait for it) he had been upgraded, tops them all. I must congratulate the way in which the flight attendant managed the situation but it does bring home the point that airlines, including Cathay, need to be very careful how and who they choose to upgrade. The resultant dispute greatly upset all passengers in the cabin, including me of course. Add to this the constant problems I have with the Cathay website whenever I try to book some flights that are anything remotely complex (for example, 'multi-city') then I find I start to choose other airlines. Other than that the other flights were ok and the food was good - but not the wine. The evening return flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane is a winner due its very useful scheduling allowing one to get to bed before the next day in the office. I still recommend this airline but it could do with some simple management practices to overcome potentially unhappy and stressful situations.",Passive
"  I had a very unpleasant experience travelling with Ryanair from East Midlands to Warsaw Modlin. I had one small luggage (suitcase) with me. My ticket informed me of the luggage size regulations that my suitscase followed and also ticket said that I'm allowed to take one small luggage into the cabin. The gate lady came up to me and put a yellow band around my suitcase and it then went inside with the other luggage. After Landing at Modlin airport my suitcase came out with a broken lock and a broken zip, on top of that next the zip stitches holding the suitcase together were broken - it look like somebody was trying to get into the suitcase.

You can buy some meal on board for normal airline price but with regard to the staff, they were quite rude. When return flight I asked them ""excuse me"" because I wanted to go back to sit, she said me rudely ""wait I can't now"". I decided no more Wizz Air.

"  At the beginning of the year I booked 4 first class seats London-Kansas USA for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. My mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to Virgin and other carriers.

"  Orlando to Chicago. I was supposed to take a vacation during in early September. Then hurricane Irma was supposed to hit right when I was going to fly in. When I found out the Orlando airport was getting shut down, I called both companies to move my flights up another week thinking If the hurricane did not hit my destination that it would be back up and running by then. Frontier Airlines gave me no problems, but Spirit was ready to charge me their everyday fee to change my flight. I spoke to a supervisor with Spirit and they allowed me to change it for 1 week later. The following week, my resort was still going to be shut down until almost half way through my stay. I sent an email requesting a refund or credit with frontier and they refunded me with no problem. It looked as though I would need to call Spirit and did so explaining that I would not be in Orlando to take part in their flight from Orlando to Chicago because of the after effects of hurricane Irma. They said they could not do anything for me.

So, if there is two of you, you can only chose to wait for airport check-in and risk not to get a seat next to each other. Lousy check-in, taking ages. Staff not trained how to take payment for extra luggage, took half an hour! Airline forgot that Turkish winter time had just started, which effected in 1 hour delay (wrong slot). Airline doesn't even offer a glass of water for free. Food and drinks against payment were served only shortly before landing. Dropped my fork, got a new one after 10 minutes.

" Charleston to Newark. I have flown with United for 4 years consistently now and have never had such a horrible experience as today. Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful. The horrid stories of this airline disregarding customers needs or even attempting to be helpful have never been more evident than today and I am overjoyed with the care and kindness shown by Delta airlines.

"  Flying Turkish Airlines is always a good if not great experience regardless of what class you are flying. But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city.

By far the worst airline, and when I read reviews for Flybe, it got really bad reviews but in fact that was my best flight. Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag.

" San Francisco to Portland. This was the worst flight in my entire life and I am 62 years old. I will NEVER fly United Airlines again. We started boarding on time and were about 1/2 full when they asked us to deplane for a maintenance issue. At first, we weren't told when they thought we might take iff. Then every 1/2 hr they would say it would be another 1/2 hr before we knew anything. I learned more about the problem in United's texts than from their Customer Service personnel. We finally were told it was ONE indicator light that wasn't working. After 2 1/2 hours they told people about another possible flight leaving at 7 pm. The problem with that was it was completely FULL & had people on standby. So you could give up a PAID RESERVATION for a seat on another flight with the slight possibility of getting on. This made no sense. They finally brought out free water and snacks but never bothered announcing this so by the time I'd heard about it they were all gone. They then changed our gate to a less comfortable location with fewer seats. People were seating on the floor. I've got health issues and this entire experience was awful .

"  First time with China Southern from Sydney to Frankfurt via Guangzhou, and return from Amsterdam to Sydney via Guangzhou. First leg a pretty new aircraft, second leg an older one, both clean and the toilets kept clean during the flight. Full flat horizontal seats on both. Easy check-in and boarding. Very helpful, polite and accommodating crew. Food was a mixed bag, western and Chinese options. Some good, some we had to pass. Plenty of drinks and water offered, but sometimes the white wine was not cold enough in the plane and the Guangzhou lounge. On the way to Frankfurt you have to know, that you have to immigrate technically into China in Guangzhou. You get a 24hr Visa on the spot. Then the next flight is a short domestic flight to Changsha where you leave the plane, a U-turn at the gate and depart China. Same plane from Changsha to Frankfurt. Not a big deal, but a surprise.

"  Shanghai to Hong Kong return, out on Cathay Dragon and returning on Cathay Pacific. Although I miss the old Dragonair logo, the transition between the two airlines has become almost seamless. On Cathay Dragon to HKG, the business class was configured in a 2x2x2 layout. The seats were very comfortable and I appreciated the new streamlined tray tables and side seat pocket. The food was dim sum, which was good but nothing spectacular. The rose flavored prosecco cocktail handed out during boarding was very good, and I enjoyed the choice of wines. Service was quite standard, but I felt that there were too many flight attendants for such a small business class section, giving the sensation of lots of people buzzing around the cabin. On the way back, the flight was operated by Cathay Pacific and featured the 1-2-1 herringbone layout which I much preferred for the privacy. Food was great - I had the sweet and sour fish and champagne. However, if I had one complaint it was again there were too many FAs in business class, making the aisles appear crowded. The departure lounge at SHA was also a disappointment but that's more on Shanghai Hongqiao airport rather than Cathay.

LIS-ZAG via BLQ business. My return flight back within one month. At this occasion more or less the same thing. Uncomfortable seats where the lumbar part is squeezing you inside. No pitch at all and the middle seat 01E next to me was occupied even if there were 2 empty seats in row 2 and 3. As it was Easter Thursday some economy pax were upgraded to C allowing us to have less space as usual. If I compare the 980 euro C class to other carriers than it is definitely not worth spending that kind of money for the same cabin as economy. The food was one course only and acceptable. Cabin crew service was incompetent unhelpful and mainly hidden in the rear galley during 5h flight. No welcome drink no entertainment no newspapers no nothing.

Once the flight was airborne for Sydney, he decided to offer me, along with the passenger beside me a bottle of water and welcomed us back and said ""if there is anything I can do to make your journey more comfortable, please let myself or the crew know"". I was taken by surprise and blown away by the gesture as it rarely happens when flying in economy. The rest of the crew were also pleasant. WIFI was on offer, the speed was decent and the IFE had new content, amazing as always. Looking forward to my next trip.",Promoter
" Our flight from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to Vancouver (YVR) has been changed from Sunday 8:15 PM to 7:30 AM (12:45 hours in advance) and this has cause me and my husband to shorter my paid vacation by 1 day. We have been forced to wake up at 2 AM on Sunday morning in order to take the transportation to the airport. It is unacceptable to be treated in this way since nobody has even informed us that the flight has been changed and we've found out the news from other people in the pool. We were very close to miss our flight that day. Therefore , it is the airline responsibility to reimburse us for the time and money lost since our dream vacation has been ruined .",Detractor
"Great value for money. We flew from Manchester to Santorini and then returned from Athens to Manchester with easyJet. Both flights were on time and pleasant. Aircraft were clean and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. They came through the cabin twice for food and beverage sales, once for duty free, and several times to collect rubbish. Extra legroom seats were an excellent value and include Speedy Boarding and use of the much quicker check-in queue. Seats on our flights did not recline, so there were no problems with rude people reclining too much and trapping people in the row behind them. We would use easyJet again.",Promoter

"  Worst experience of my life. If you have been to El Paso, TX you know how small this airport is. I've been flying International for years with Delta and United Airlines, never had an issue arriving 90 min prior. We arrived at 5am for our 6.30 flight, the line was at end of the opposite side of the airport (only airline that had any line) they had 7 different airplanes leaving within minutes of each other. We finally get to the front, our attendant is assisting another attendant who is having a hard time explaining to another customer about their cat boarding, took another 10 minutes to assist us, finally gets to us â€œsorry they've closed the check in 5 minutes agoâ€. They rebooked for the next day with a 6 hour lay over in Dallas. I've been on hold for 50 minutes now (and counting) to try to get fly us one day after our scheduled back date.

"  Dubai to Manchester. Boarded the plane at the last minute owing to delayed previous flight. The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.",Passive
" Fort Lauderdale to Newark. I arrived to the airport 2 hours before the flight. I was checked in a day before and when I came to the gate, I was told that I am on the wrong flight even though I had my boarding pass. They told me that they have no time to talk to me and I should go to customer service. The line in customer service was like 20 people and a lady who worked there was super rude and just yelled at me that she â€œI can't deal with herâ€. She was rude and unprofessional. When I run back to the gate, there were about 20 people with the same issue, all were told that they are not in the system. After the lady yelled at me that I am in the wrong flight and not even looking at my boarding pass, I had to wait an hour. 5 minutes before departure I finally got a new boarding pass and when I came in to the flight someone was sitting on my seat and they also had the boarding pass with the same seat. I do not understand how business can function with such a horrible customer service, with super rude people. It is unacceptable to have this issue. Everyone was treated horrible on the flight. There were rude women in customer service and other 2 ladies had no idea what was going on. Also, there was a gum on my seat and my jeans were completely destroyed. I requested the refund for the damaged item and they told me to submit a receipt. It what I did. Lady replied, that she received everything and check will be mailed to me. A month later, they said that I have to submit a different claim, and they have never received anything even after I showed them that my email clearly states that a lady received my receipt.",Detractor

"In July of 2015, I booked a South African Airways flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg on the South African Airlines website, leaving January 4th 2016. A week later, I received an email notifying me that the flight times had changed and that I need to log on to their website and accept these changes. The change was a little inconvenient, but I did it anyway. Three days later, I got another email notifying me of a change that required me to visit their website. Again, the change was inconvenient, but I accepted. Then another email came. At that point, I tried to contact their customer service department by email to work out what was going on. I didn't want to call their pay number from abroad for obvious reasons, but I kept getting emails notifying me of changes to my flight times without any response from their customer service department. It took multiple complaints to many different branches of the same airline before they finally sent me an email message essentially telling me that if I didn't like their service I could cancel the booking, by which time fares on that route had risen more than 40%. I raised this issue with them and, after many emails backwards and forwards, they promised to look into alternatives and get back to me. That was exactly one month ago and I've not heard from them since. I'm actually quite impressed by how little they care.",Detractor
SFO-EWR (round trip) 4/24-4/28. One of the better airlines I've flown for domestic. The seats were more comfortable than the other airlines I have been on (Delta American). Staff were pretty friendly although at times were not as available as I would have liked. The food I would order did come almost instantly which I was very impressed about. Overall nothing to really complain about the flight and airline itself.

"Undependable, rude service. My last round trip one flight was delayed 7 hrs (weather delay which I know you can't control) the other 4hrs. The flight with 8 hr delay - myself and a few passengera went out to the desk because we could not rebook at gate which doesn't make sense. There was 15 to 20 people in line, and five behind counter and two standing infront. Four were helping the same customer, 2 were on their phones, and the last one was sitting on the luggage carousel. When I finally got to front I asked about re-booking, she informed me there were only 4 seats for following days flight. Told if I want to get where I'm going I should just be patient and wait. I smiled and walked away and ""patiently waited"". On my return flight, it was at 1.30pm, I started getting emails at 8am that it was going to be delayed and gate changed. I paid for seat and checked bag online in order to get through faster, but there was no bag drop line so had to wait in line for 40 minutes to get a tag for bag. When got to the counter I was told the flight was delayed again and L7 was the new gate. When arrived at airports both times after landing late, had to sit on runway for an hour to get a gate.

"Just came back from a trip to Orlando from Toronto. Purchased my tickets on Air Canada only to find out a few weeks before that I got ""Rouged"". I am an Air Canada Altitude Elite 50K member and fly on mainline AC quite frequently. When I bought my ticket in April 2013 I expected to fly on the airline I originally booked with but that was not the case. They switched my flight without warning. Getting on the plane the first thing you notice is how they squeezed all the seats together to give you no leg room. Unless you are a young child your knees will be plastered against the seat back in front of you. Good luck with the inflight non-entertainment system - you will need to remember to charge your device completely because there are no outlets. Also the movies were all second rate. Best of luck trying to get any work done the cramped room does not allow a regular sized laptop to be placed on the tray table without being squeezed between your abdomen and the seat in front.",Detractor

YYZ-MCO return. Service and food were up to mainline AC business class standards however the seats were regular Rouge but with a much better seat pitch. Since they do not sell the middle seat I see no reason why they could not go the extra mile and have wider seats. All the privileges of AC Business class: free checked bags priority boarding Maple Leaf Lounge access priority security at MCO all made it worth the extra cost which was not too excessive. Not particularly impressed with the iPad entertainment system but it worked and there was a reasonable choice of things to watch. This is by far the only way to survive Rouge. I looked back to the cheap seats and it looked awful: an impression confirmed by some who traveled back there. Not up to AC Business Class mainly due to the poor seating but acceptable for a relatively short flight.,Passive

FR505 Bristol UK to Dublin IE August 19th. With all the bad press and negative reviews about Ryanair I vowed never to fly with them. However on balance it was better than expected. Friendly flight attendants and apologies about the slight delay on departure. There was enough leg room for my liking even being a male of average height and the aircraft was clean. The only thing I would do is remove the garish yellow. But that's a matter of taste. Ultimately exceeded my expectations so kudos to Ryanair. I think the key is to stick to the rules which have been relaxed slightly recently and you'll be just fine. Wouldn't really advise priority boarding as it was pointless with seating now being allocated.,Promoter
" Dublin to Paris. I had the opportunity to travel with my family and a group of other families who have special children on various treatments. We travelled to Disneyland Paris. Check in was a little bit disorganised but we ended up sailing through security as a designated area had been kindly provided. Onboard on the out ward journey, we had great care and attention by our cabin crew member who was so nice to all the children and the parents. I hope that if the company are reading this they can pass on our sincerest thanks for the care and attention we received by her. She had a natural warmth and empathy that was the style of the old Aer Lingus and that's what used to set EI apart from it's rivals. We arrived on time and it was nice to hear the cabin crew wishing all the children a pleasant stay in Disneyland as they hare a very special bunch of people. Back to Dublin we had a fairly standard service from the crew. Again arrived on time. I would be delighted to fly EI again but it would be nice to see more of the genuineness and friendliness that we experienced on our outward flight.

She tried to add a baggage to the aircraft online after the booking, again with no luck. Therefore we had to pay for our check in and our bag when we got to the airport. It was Â£110 there and Â£110 back. Basically the cost of another flight!! The staff at the check in counter at Luton were rude and unprofessional. And on the flight coming home from Tel Aviv, the air stewardess moved us from our seats at the front which my daughter paid additionally for so we could be comfortable and sat us at the back of the airline.

Second flight took off 45 minutes late but landed around 45 minutes early. Seats are comfy enough not amazing. Staff were pleasant. Food was better than a lot of other airlines I have been on.

The cabin crew ran out of options during the meal service. The options were japanese chicken rice and the other one was fish with rice, yet only the fish left. The crew showed me the fish rice, which personally I must say very not appetizing. Then, he took initiative to try to find me the Japanese chicken rice, which was completely finished on board. Finally, he went to the galley, and offered the crew meal, which was chicken with indonesian yellow rice. I agreed to take this. I was amazed by the crew's action to go beyond my expectations.

"  This was an excellent experience on Premium Economy. Naturally the half empty cabin helps, but all in all, I can safely say that Norwegian's premium product is far better than BA, AF, and Cathay. And it is still better than an equally empty cabin on AA. Service is limited, but for a day flight, we got two very good meals. The vegetarian option was equally good. Two things make the product better than the much more expensive rivals: Seat comfort: leg space and overall comfort is almost like an old business class seat. And the 2-3-2 configuration makes it less crowded than the 2-4-2 of others. Cabin configuration: besides the seat arrangement, the key thing is that the premium cabin is large, and, in the absence of a business class, it is up front. So you get 10 rows isolated from the rest of the plane, with 2 reserved toilets. On most other airlines the â€œpremiumâ€ cabin is 4 rows of seats sandwiched between business and economy. It is actually economy with a better seat. Free-WiFi is a plus, although a very slow plus. The only downside for such a long flight is the entertainment system. Choices are limited, but to be fair, still better than BA. I have flown on 787s before, but this is the first time that I enjoyed. The plane is well suited for a day flight. The cleaner and more humid air helps, and the automatic shades keeps the cabin â€œopenâ€ to the skies without the glaring sunshine. Looking forward to the next opportunity to fly with them. The price/quality ratio is unbeatable.",Promoter
  They will never tell you the truth! For this flight from Bogota to Fort Lauderdale with Jetblue we've been in the airport for almost 6 hours. We boarded the plane and after 2 hours we were advised it would be taken to a hangar. 2 hours later we were told we would return to the airport for food. After 1.5 hours in line we got some horrible food. No information from the airline after 6 hours. What I see is many passengers that are already in their second delay because of the same issue. It seems it is the way it works. There is no one to speak to - just write an email and wait for response which can take one month.,Detractor

My flight was delayed 6 hours from Singapore to Shanghai due to fog. Supposedly departing at 1225am, I depart at 7am. So I missed my connecting flight to Seoul Incheon. The inflight entertainment, for my seat on all 4 flights I took my the TV has a problem. It switched off and on on its own. I clicked English and it went to chinese. Their movies are all Chinese speaking even if its an english movie. On reaching the queue to transfer was a mess. I'm supposed to transfer to connecting flight, however the flight was delayed till 5pm. Not only that, I dont know why they asked us to enter China, meaning stamped our passports, exit and check in again. The staff are shouting at each other. They show attitude when passengers don't understand them because of their lousy English. When I approached China Eastern, I wanted to enquire about my flight delay, and ask if they could compensate because they took my 1 day in Korea. The guy immediately asked me to speak to his supervisor because he does not know how to communicate in english. So I spoke to the supervisor, and he blatantly ignored me. This guy is a representative of China Eastern, and he's the same guy that ignored all other people who speak English. I had ordered special meal due to religion but when I got on my connecting flight, my special order was not indicated because my flight was changed due to the delay.

" I was scheduled to fly from Washington DC (IAD) to Newark (EWR) with United Airlines and then continue via SAS from EWR to Copenhagen. Due to weather issues in the greater NY area the United flight was delayed by 6 hours and my connecting flight had left when I arrived at EWR. At IAD I had explained to United agents that my luggage was checked in all the way to Copenhagen, and that I needed guidance regarding if/how/where I needed to pick up my luggage when arriving in EWR. I was simply told to explain my situation to United agents when arriving at EWR. Following guidance from the United flight crew I stood in line for two hours to speak to a United agent at the United EWR customer care booth located next to my arrival gate. When I finally talked to an agent I was asked to go to the United baggage claim booth. After having waited another hour the United baggage claim agent informed me that she had located the luggage, but that I had to wait at least another 5 hours for my bag to be brought to the United baggage claim area. I was then told to show up 8.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage (*note that after arriving at EWR Scandinavian Airlines had manage to re-book me via American Airlines to go to Miami and then via a SAS flight to Copenhagen). By the time United told me to leave without my luggage it was 12.30 AM in the night â€“ 12.5 hours after departing IAD airport. I was offered no hotel options. After having spent 35 min a cab to reach a friend's apartment in NYC I spent another 30 min in a cab ($150 out of pocket) and returned to EWR 7.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage. A third United agent then told me that they could not locate my luggage in their system and that it likely was with SAS. I was then told that since the SAS office only opens 9 AM the right thing would have been to wait the five hours the previous night. This conversation took 30 secs and it was made very clear that this was not United problem and that I was advised to board my American Airlines flight without my luggage and file a lost luggage complaint with SAS upon arriving in Copenhagen, which I then did. I arrived in Copenhagen 8 am and had to continue straight to my air-bnb and then to the university. At this point I had slept 2-3 hours since my departure at Dulles on the 19th (2 days ago) and I had no new clothes to change into. Upon returning to IAD from Copenhagen on June 24th I still had not received my luggage. After being passed from one United agent to another at IAD I was told that my luggage was at EWR. I filed a lost luggage complaint with United and since received around 10 text messages saying that my luggage was not located. Early morning 12.39 AM on June 27th, while asleep, I get a text by a private company contracted by United stating that they are â€œattempting to deliver my luggageâ€ and I am asked to call/text to confirm my address. 6.02 AM I write back to confirm my address and I text the private agent to call me before dropping off my luggage. I leave my apartment 6.40 AM only to discover that the private agent had left my luggage outside my building without notifying me.",Detractor

They then said we had to get off again. I am not usually comfortable on a plane as a starting point and knowing that I had to get back on this plane rather than get us a new plane was very uneasing.

As I settled into my seat, I watched my luggage being loaded on the plane parked next to me. I alerted the flight attendant, who quickly reached out to the supervisor to intervene. After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude.

I spent 2 nights in airports and instead of Nicaragua Spirit left me in San Pedro Sula, somewhere I had never been before which google says is the most dangerous city on earth. Spirit Airlines is an organization that only knows how to take your money. This was the worst flight experience of my life.

Thirty minutes prior to departure we asked the Spirit gate agent what time the flight boards. The gate agent told us the flight was closed. That made no sense, one of my fellow passengers told the Spirit gate agent. The gate agent, to my shocked surprise, began cursing at the passenger. No one at the airport could help me. The two gate agents were mean and rude. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with three different customer service agents, none of which spoke English very well. One agent advised me to rent a car and drive from Philadelphia airport to Pittsburgh, to catch a flight leaving about 90 minutes later. Philadelphia is about a 5 hour drive to Pittsburgh.

"  Stansted to Abu Dhabi via Istanbul. If you are looking for a dirt cheap flight without any comfort then this might be the airline for you. That is the plus side. Tried to checkin 72 hours in advance and the site was down. When I eventually tried to check in they told me that check in was prohibited for me. Called their call centre and he told me that online checkin was not available for British citizens. He stated it was a UK government directive. The agent at the airport stated that was not correct. So no online checkin not available for British citizens apparently. When I said I would like to select an isle seat he said we do not allow passengers to select seats on checkin and you would get a middle seat. So passengers who checkin early get the worst seats. Arrived at the airport 3 hours early and spent 90 minutes in the queue, back staring to hurt. Representative at the airport said she had never heard of such a government directive reading checkin of British passport holders. So their agent was not truthful to cover up a poor service. Check in was fine, delightful lady. Plane late departure due to excessive checkin times/queues, late aircraft arrival, Euro traffic control or congestion in Turkish airspace. All were give. However departure staff at the gate were very pleasant. Boeing 737-800 out of STN. Where did they buy those seats? Well disguised wooden bench. Very uncomfortable. Pointless paying for extra legroom as I did. Boeing 737-800 out of SAW, no seat recline, no pocket to put things in and no cushion effect. No inflight entertainment either. The in light map was looking out if the window. Finally you pay for everything. Food, tea, coffee, water and seat selection.",Detractor
Aircraft was clean and inflight team efficient and friendly. I recognise this airline offers stripped down fares and charges for luggage and seats etc normally provided free by other carriers. In view of this it is essential to get the management of providing these extras under control and that is not what I found. Having reserved a seat online and booking priority check-in at the airport my booking was not on the system and the seat not available. On the return no priority check-in available so I queued. The worst thing was that my complaint was badly handled and I was pointed to the small print in the Conditions of Carriage saying seat reservations don't definitely reserve you a seat and Priority Check-in is not refundable. Travelling is difficult enough without this type of response from carriers. Such a pity.,Detractor
" Barcelona to Houston via Frankfurt. My Lufthansa flight from Barcelona to Frankfurt in May was delayed and I was not able to take the connecting Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Houston on my pre-booked Premium Economy class. Lufthansa asked me to change the flight and rebooked me other flight with economy class. I had no choice but took it. By doing that, I lost the privilege of the services of Premium Economy and reduced flyer program points. I purchased the more expensive Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa and was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. After the trip, I contacted Lufthansa and they refused any compensation associated with this trip. This is an extremely bad experience with Lufthansa. It is not worth the money to purchase Premium Economy Class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of Premium Economy Class when there is a delay in flight that is not your fault.",Detractor

"I've been commuting between RDU to EWR for the past few months. As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark. What I've learned - you pay double the price for United as opposed to other airlines for delays and cancellations due to ""flight crew availability"". I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges. As far as recommending United - use at your own risk and be prepared to have a Plan B C and D for when your cancelled due to lack of availability of flight crew.",Detractor
" AM 698. Check in at Mexico City Airport was a bit slowish due to the fact that many international flights were leaving mid-afternoon. While boarding the plane newspapers as well as candy were offered on the jetway, once on board the aircraft we were handed out headphones. The crew on this flight were rather courteous. This flight was on a Boeing with Sky Interior which had bigger bins and private TVs on every seat with a wide selection of movies. For this flight I chose row 29 since the last few rows offer an extra seat of legroom. After take off people were offered bottles of water, about thirty minutes after that beer, spirits, sodas and juices as well as a bag with peanuts or some sort of trail mix. Since I was in the back I had no choice on dinner but at least food is free. I was offered pasta with veggies and cheese, yoghurt, beer, salad and bread, there was another drink service mid flight and prior to landing more water bottles were offered. By far this was a great five hour flight, crew were very attentive and curious and you get better perks than what American carriers offer on flights between Mexico and the USA.",Promoter

He was so sick on our way to Oregon that we were running back to the bathroom every 45 minutes. They were kind and generous and offered to help me during this very stressful flight. On the way back home my son was feeling better and we did not need as much help or support. Although, we received it anyway. Both crews offered help, extra drinks or snacks through out the flights, as well as offering to help me off the plane. I cannot remember the last time I had such a positive experience on any airline.

Reasonably quiet, easy to get on and off and very comfortable to ride in. CX has always had a good product on both the hard, aircraft, side and then the soft skills. Typically Asian service, efficient and with a smile. The IFE was good with plenty of choice for a mid haul of 9 hours. I declined the breakfast service (congee, fruit or eggs) as 4 am is a bit rich and early for my palate.

"  Staff are completely unprofessional. We have flown with our baby multiple times and purchase her a seat even though it is not necessary until they are two. The flight attendants on this trip flying from Montana to Phoenix via Salt Lake City have been terrible - they are completely rude and have to awareness of how to cater to family travelers. The flight attendants tried to make us check our car seat multiple times even though the manufacturer website clearly shows the seat is airline approved. Also we have a Chico key fit 30 which is one of the most popular car seats sold and I would hope before trying to make us check it unnecessarily they would be up to date on the most commonly approved seats. A child can sit in a lap with no seat so I do not see the issue for what seat is traveled with. After throwing a big fuss over our seat and getting management involved and all the other passengers involved telling them it is approved they finally with disgruntled looks on their faces ""let"" us use the seat as an exception! They acted like they were doing a favor by not having us check the seat when it is clearly approved on the website. I am disgusted to pay for a seat and be treated this way as if they are doing us a courtesy.

An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.,Promoter
"This new ANA daily direct service from Brussels to Tokyo Narita in Premium Economy was very good in both directions. The 38 inch seat pitch and 21 seat separate Premium Economy cabin was great and defintely worth paying extra for. The economy section in the rear appeared cramped and claustrophobic. ANA service in premium economy was professional and attentive although the meals (apart from the business class dessert - Haagen Daz ice cream!) are the same as in economy. Whilst the meals (choice of Japanese or Western) were not great drinks and snacks are available free throughout the whole flight. ANA staff at check in both Brussels and Tokyo were courteous, efficient and professional - something other airlines should take note of. If I had any criticism, the three toilets in the rear of the 787 for the whole of the economy section seemed a bit inadequate but the crew kept them perfectly clean and serviceable so no great concern overall. The fact that half the plane is taken by business seats also means there is not alot of room in the rear of the 787 to walk around. However overall a great product with excellent ANA service and a flight time of 11.5 hours between Brussels and Tokyo - recommended.",Promoter

" This was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. First the check in staff were rude and told us as we were boarding that the overhead bins were already full (why?) and we had to check in our cabin baggage. They told us that it would be checked through to Auckland. When I said no, they insisted or we couldn't fly. We still had a 12.5 hour flight from LA to NZ after this one with no carry on and whatever we could keep on us personally. Get on the plane no greeting, ignored. Inflight, crew scowling at passengers. One crew member, while collecting rubbish, looked each passenger in the face and just said ""trash"" at them. Land in LA, no idea where we had to go for our connecting flight, no info anywhere. Went to the United customer service and asked them, they were annoyed we were asking and pointed to where we had to go. I double checked that our luggage was checked all the way through and we were asked for our bag tags. The United check in person back in Washington hadn't given us any on our boarding passes! Finally get to Auckland, no luggage, even the carry on. United hadn't loaded any of it onto ANZ. Been home for 24 hours now, no luggage still.

A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat.

" Dubai to Hanoi via Guangzhou. The first leg was longhaul and deserves 10/10 on a smart designed A330 business class cabin in a 1-2-1 configuration with very narrow aisles. FAs and care was excellent. FA extremely caring and humble but proactive throughout and even bowed and kneeled for the passengers. Champagne and wines resemble those offered at 5 start airlines. Food, menus, winelists, amenity kits, and IFE provided several options and were all good or even close to perfect. Highly responsive large touch screens supplied with with noise cancelling headsets. Ground staff were excellent at check-in and even at transit they were waiting for me to ensure that I did not miss my next connection which only had a 65 Minutes time slip. Both flights on time. Airport in Guangzhou is well functioning and quick to pass or transit in. Good lounges in Dubai and Guangzhou. The 2nd leg only deserves 6/10 despite the FAs were faultless. The poor hardware on 2nd flight appeared with very cramped business seats in a single front row on an A319 aircraft. Food were modest and drinks were very limited (only beer and water). Seats were nice.I was the sole passenger in business and they have loaded 4 cans of beer for me (Warsteiner and Tsingtao). Food mediocre, but edible.

JFK-Frankfurt-Budapest then Vienna-Munich-JFK. Tried to book seats online after booking flight but now Lufthansa only allows seats to be booked online by paying a fee (amount depending on the seat chosen) until 23 hours prior to the flight time when online booking of remaining seats is free. First aggravation. Start was delayed 2.5-3 hours due to late arrival of aircraft at JFK- no weather problems all other European flights left on time only this Lufthansa flight was late. The plane was a 747-8 not full had 3 seats for myself. Food not of high quality but the service throughout was exemplary - superb. Arriving in Frankfurt of course missing connecting flight to Budapest with a 4.5 wait for next flight. Asked Lufthansa in Frankfurt if I could have use of a lounge during the long wait and was outright denied that privilege though they gave me a 10 Euro certificate for something to eat in the meantime but as we had passed customs there were no restaurants available in that area only snack bars so had a torte. Flight to Budapest was routine sandwich and drinks. Luggage arrived timely in Budapest. Return to JFK with short flight Vienna to Munich (drinks but no snacks) - then Airbus 330 Munich to JFK which was quite cramped as to seating even on the aisle. Food barely passed muster (metal cutlery though) as Lufthansa has declined dramatically in their culinary department but again the Flight attendants were magnificent many drink runs and staff courtesy and organization superior to both Swissair and Austrian flown on similar routes in the last months (Austrian has the best food of the 3 airlines but being owned now by Lufthansa that too has declined considerably from a few years ago). The new 747-8 had a quieter flight than most other planes flying transatlantically. Without the inability to book seats earlier than 23 hours before each flight and the very late departure of the flight to Frankfurt from JFK I would rank Lufthansa higher than a 3 - probably an 8 despite uninteresting bland meals.,Detractor

" Indianapolis to Orlando. This was my first experience with Frontier and I have to say that I was not impressed. My flight going to Indianapolis was fine, no hitches. Nothing spectacular happened, the kiosk to self-check in was unavailable and there were no snacks/drinks, and you have to pay for carry-ons. Sure, it's a cheap ticket. My problem is how they dealt with my returning flight to Orlando. In that it didn't happen. They ended up sending an email probably near an hour before the flight was set to board and we were all checked in. They apologize but flight's been cancelled. Okay, sometimes that happens (though not in such a discrete manner...with rumors about relocating our flight because of stranded individuals for Las Vegas that they cancelled the day before OR that everyone was alerted over the announcements from an employee who prefaced by saying ""Don't no one come up to yell at me but..."") and they'll accommodate for our inconvenience. Lo and behold, they will only reimburse max of $400 per ticket bought from another airline. Cheapest flights that day? $423. For flights that would take longer due to not being direct like the cancelled flight, and wouldn't go out until later that day. We have to pay for new tickets on the spot. Well fine, let's deal with the reimbursement online form. Oh, it doesn't work, it errors out twice for me on Chrome. Let's call customer service: No options for questions and concerns. Okay...let's ask the employee on site: ""We gotta deal with getting this plane out first"" I didn't even ask yet, just came up but alright. The lady nearby that he was talking to turned to me. She was nice enough, gave me a number (same one) and said to do the Feedback option. Weird but okay. After a good bit of waiting on hold, I get someone who doesn't understand me clearly maybe because of the noise in the airport? Sure. Repeat myself and get put on hold a couple times, once because he thought I was cancelling my own flight and looking to rebook on Frontier. ""Can you wait two days? That's the next one we have."" ""I'm sorry, no, we already got our new Delta tickets, I just want to get reimbursed and see if we can have the entire tickets reimbursed not just the 400 max."" After awhile of re-clarifying, he realizes what I'm asking and confirms. ""I will get my tickets completely reimbursed? The entire 423 each?"" ""Yes, ma'am, yes"" ""And I'll get the 200 vouchers as well?"" ""Yes"" ""Good, thank you very much"" He also let me know that I should try another browser instead of chrome to not error out. Cool. So I re-do my reimbursement application while also adding onto the pictures of papers I send that I spoke to an agent who told me that I will get reimbursed the full amount along with the vouchers. Get a confirmation email that it's gone through. Near two weeks later: checks for 400 each, no vouchers in sight. Boyfriend tries to deal with them (he's more of a principled hothead), goes up superiors, .but gets nowhere with all refusing to reimburse the tickets we had to purchase just to get home because of their cancelled flight. It's not like they refunded us the cancelled flight either because of us choosing the option for reimbursement(it was either/or). Finally, he calls them back, requests an American employee (I know, he's bad), and they will try to resend the vouchers. Guess that's the best we'll get, be further in the hole from this single round-trip through Frontier that we thought would be kind to our wallets.",Detractor

Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight.

Quick and easy check in on time take off and early arrival back into Manchester. Aircraft was clean with adequate leg room. My gripe is that the flight had around 25 English soldiers flying back to the UK! I have to say the majority were absolutely fine but we had 3 sat in front of us throughout the flight were joined by another friend that stood up directly at the side of me for me for the first 3 hours of the flight. I am all for having a good time but the steady flow of alcohol that was served then lead to disgusting language being used! I spoke to the stewardess about asking the man to sit down in his seat but was told that there was not much they could do. I felt she completely dismissed my comments and was not even willing to speak to them about their language. There should be a cut off point where alcohol is no longer served!,Detractor
"I recently flew Qatar Airways from London to Bangkok via Doha, returning from Ho Chi Minh City. Around 1.5 hours into your journey you get the meal service. This wasn't preceded with a drinks service, the drink was served with the meal, and service was incredibly slow. After the trays were collected, cabin lights are dimmed, and turned back on two hours before landing where you are given a snack (on the 6 hour leg from LHR to DOH this meant no more than two hours between meals). The snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining - this second service could take place a little later into the flight. Cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. If laptops should be turned off during landing / take off the staff should enforce this rule, not just leave it as they do the cabin check. Blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion. I have recommended this airline but it was a border line decision (swayed by good prices and on time performance).",Passive
SYD-JKT. Airfares are very competitive compared to competitors. Fast and efficient departure on-time FA's are attentive and friendly. Cabin was spacious and no problem with leg room. I got 30kg for my baggage allowance AVOD and food were pretty good compared to some other airlines. Overall I am pleased and will fly them again.,Promoter

"  Melbourne to London via Singapore. If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long. And if you want your money back then there is a $200 cancellation fee. I have cut up my Elite Gold card and will never fly with Singapore Airlines again.",Detractor
" Philadelphia to Rapid City via Denver. We took only a carry on, no checked luggage to avoid unnecessary delays at the airport. Upon boarding the aircraft they took our carry-on as they said the overhead compartments were full. Once the aircraft was fully boarded, we were told there is a delay while they service the front strut on the plane. During the flight the WiFi didn't work. We arrived in Denver late and had to run through the airport to catch our next flight to Rapid City. We were to late to board, but they said it doesn't matter as the flight was going to be canceled for bad weather. When the flight was canceled we decided to drive to Rapid City, we requested our carry-on luggage which we should of had with us if but United took it from us. It took United Airlines 3 hours and 15 minutes to get the luggage from the canceled flight to the claim area. The staff was rude and uncaring, they said it can take up to 4 hours. Not 1 United employee apologized in any way for the canceled flight or the delay in retrieving our luggage. We paid $328.80 per ticket and United Airlines gave us a measly $101.94 back as a refund, for a flight they never provided. United Airlines service is terrible and they will rip you off! All appeals just fell on deaf ears.. F- The only thing they got right is we landed safely in Denver Colorado, half way to our destination.",Detractor

"Perth to Vancouver via Guangzhou. We chose China Southern business class due to the price and because we could fly into Vancouver and out of LA. Also, the flight times were more attractive than flying from Perth through Sydney or Brisbane. We took advantage of the free night in Guangzhou because of a longer than 8 hour transit time on the way out. This was all handled very efficiently after a pretty good flight. The business class seats on the Boeing 787 were comfortable and food and wine acceptable. Not up to same standards of Qatar or Singapore Airlines but had paid much less for the tickets! Cheap headphones but okay inflight entertainment. We were met at Guangzhou airport (names on a board) and escorted through immigration to the Pullman Hotel, which offered a very comfortable room, good breakfast the next day. We paid for our dinner. We checked our bags direct from Perth to Vancouver and had a change of clothes etc in hand luggage. So it was easy checking in at the transit lounge for the onward flight to Vancouver - also a Boeing 787, but we were not offered pyjamas for 12 hour overnight flight. Food and wine acceptable. Flight from LA on the A380 we found the flight attendants in need of training. We had to ask them to hang our coats - only apple or orange juice offered prior to takeoff, the food/beverage choices limited. The seats were configured 1x2x1 and we opted for a two in the middle. The design meant that there was a very small space through which to leave our seats. The seats seemed narrower and very hard. We were given a very thin undercover as well as a duvet when settling to sleep but it made little difference. The armrests covered in very hard plastic - I used an extra pillow as it was so uncomfortable - digging into my arm when eating, reading etc. Good noise-cancelling headphones. Entertainment and amenities ok. Food was mediocre as were the wines. No other drinks offered after dinner. The toilet was not kept replenished, I had to ask them to clean and renew towels / toilet paper. A selection of snacks put out but was not replenished once many of the offerings had been consumed. Guangzhou to Perth overnight, again on a Boeing 787. We headed for the business class Lounge to have dinner so we could sleep as long as possible. Terrible lounge offered 1 white and 2 red wines, beers and soft drinks, but not much Western food and most seats taken. WiFi was slow. Food served downstairs. Sitting area upstairs. Didn't take dinner on the plane but ordered breakfast which was inedible eggs Benedictine, brought before the fruit, had to ask for coffee. Would we use China Southern again - yes, because of price but without expectation of it being the same as some airline offerings.",Detractor
"  Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik. Where to begin? This was an abysmal experience. At first glance, WOW air seems ideal because of the low prices, but don't be fooled. They charge you for everything possible, and eventually you wish you had just flown the more expensive airline without all these fees, that just add up to be the same cost as any other airline. The baggage fees are ridiculous, and one kilo overweight costs USD20 in addition to the lofty fee you're already paying to check a bag. This was a transatlantic flight, so I was less than excited to see the zero leg room and the lack of televisions anywhere on this 6 hour flight. The man across the aisle from me had his knees in the aisle because the leg space was so obscenely small. Despite the flight being so long, there were no free snacks provided. Even a glass of water was beyond expensive. I had a connecting flight in Iceland, and because the first flight was delayed, they lost my bag in the transition. I got to Paris and filled out a lost baggage form and was told it would be mailed to me in 24-48 hours. I did not receive my bag for 6 days. That is an absurd amount of time to be in another country with only a toothbrush to your name. I expected a refund for paying such a high baggage price with the expectation of the bag arriving when I did. I requested a refund and got a meaningless email saying they were only responsible to reimburse me only for ""essentials"" that I had to buy since I didn't have my bag. Completely obnoxious, so they're getting this review in response. Only positive part of the whole experience was that all the flight attendants were very nice. Never flying WOW air again. Not worth the deceptively cheap price.",Detractor
 London to Athens. I pay Â£16 to sit in a seat at the front that has a curtain right in front of me.

My sister and I travelled to Cairns Australia via Shanghai. First leg of the flight for approximately 12 hours from Heathrow to Shanghai. We were offered a drink at the start of the trip. My sister and I both asked for red wine the stewardess poured about an inch of wine in the cup. On the next visit after the meal they had run out of red wine had no beer and no other alcohol on offer! I have never been on a flight where there was no bar service! It was the same on the 3 other flights. The food was atrocious and I'm not a fussy eater. A choice of only 2 meals each time either pork and rice or beef and noodle. On one of the flights there was no choice the fish meal had run out! The staff weren't at all friendly and hardly smiled although the inflight video showed a lovely cup of coffee with very happy staff this wasn't at all what we experienced.,Detractor
Myself and my daughter took a holiday to Kos. I have never seen such a shambles in my life. After the experience of the free for all to get your seats and then seeing the arguments between other passengers as they could not sit together got the holiday off to a great start. It was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off I do understand that this is important however I have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. We were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served I think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. The list was endless of what they hadn't got. When it was our turn I ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke I was taken back a little when they said that's 11 Euros. I quickly put my money back in my pocket. All they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. Overall not impressed at all and will never travel Ryanair in the future. One final thing. Budget airline? My tickets where certainly not cheap or even reasonable.,Detractor
Nothing seems to have changed since privatisation. Apart from the fact that prices have gone up and a meal is no longer offered including on 3 hours from London to Rome. Check-in staff rude at London Thessaloniki and Rome. Asked to check in an extra bag due to a medical condition and still within the baggage limitations but was asked to pay 40 euros. Flight was only half full. Also very difficult to find the gate for the connecting flight. Crew were only friendly on leg Rome-Thessaloniki and there doesn't seem to be consistency with the service. Only Italian customers seem to get asked whether they want sweet or savoury biscuits. Otherwise they don't even greet when you board and seem preoccupied with their own chat. London to Rome half an hour late without an announcement or apology. There was a customer satisfaction survey on board between Rome and London but only a hand-full of people were picked not sure according to what criteria.,Detractor

I wanted to head out 2 hours earlier from Miami since I didn't need to sit at the airport for 10 hours. They refused to move me even though there were seats and the flight I was on was overbooked.

"I purchased 2 economy return tickets Dubai - Amsterdam - New York for myself and my wife. I found the aircraft comfort relatively good compared to other airlines. Staff are friendly but a bit ""stiff"" inflexible. When asking for a drink before the food service they said only after food service - still 45 minutes away. In the mean time at least 20 times they walked passed my seat. The main issue we faced was with our baggage. In New York at check- in one bag was 24.5kg and the other was 18kg. They still forced me to unpack the lighter bag and move 1.5kg to the other bag. I found this utterly irritating especially since the tickets where bought together and our combined allowance was higher. The only answer I got was that its the policy. We took a few days break in Schiphol. There we had an even worse baggage experience at the check in. We used one of those self baggage check in machines because the normal desk had a huge queue. We checked our first bag without a problem but the 2nd bag was 24.2kg. The machine refused to accept the overweight bag and pointed us to KLM staff. Looking at the queue we removed 1kg of clothes and put it in our hand baggage. But what a hassle and that despite that we were far below our total baggage quota for 2 persons. It may deter me from flying KLM next time.",Passive

No more pre-boarding for passengers with children really? On a recent flight my family was instructed that Delta no longer allows passengers with small children to pre-board because there is now a pre-board fee that passengers are paying and 'got upset' that others were allowed to do so for free. This is yet another example of how Delta airlines are cutting service and delaying the overall boarding process. As a business owner and traveler I understand the desire to make money but this is going too far! Going forward I will research flights and airlines that are willing to accommodate my traveling family. My extra dollars will be well spent on an airline that values service first and foremost.,Passive
Flight was 2 hours late leaving and then spent an hour on the runway with no air conditioning in San Juan. PR in June 2014. The heat got so bad someone had an asthma attack and the plane was forced to return to the gate. The medical case person was removed and then maybe 6 or 8 more people just got off. The delay made our group of 9 miss our connection. They offered us 3 hotel rooms and $21 in vouchers for food for a 24 hour layover. The vouchers were written wrong and only 1 restaurant would take them and 3 people had to use the same voucher. When the tickets were issued for the flight they left off all the paid carry-on bags. Not a single agent could even figure out how to add them back. This caused more trouble.,Detractor
London-Bangkok-London. This is our second time with EVA Airway and they are a brilliant airline. The Elite Class cabin is extremely spacious and you feel relaxed at all times and that is what you want for the start of your holiday. The staff were so friendly and efficient throughout the flight bringing drinks and snacks constantly and if you need anything they are quick to respond. There were 6 of us in our party and two were new to EVA Airways and this is why we chose them to make sure that their flight was a comfortable one due to our previous experience. I have read some previous reviews about people having problems with foot space due to the entertainment boxes under the seats being in the way but I think that this is a ridiculous comment as there is plenty of space to stretch your feet. We have travelled extensively and also myself with work and we have been extremely impressed with EVA Airways and would definitely recommend them.,Promoter

We were able to check in through a separate line which was quick however we had to wait in line with all other passengers, for an extended period of time to check in our baggage. Extra seat space is still minimal. Regular seat leg room with this airline is very cramped! On the return from Punta Cana, we were processed in a separate line and our baggage was taken, however when it came time to board the plane we were in a very long lineup, with everyone else, with really no order to the boarding process at all.

"  A terrible experience with Vueling Airlines. We were initially booked onto a 7.10am flight from Rome to London Gatwick. This then changed to 12.30pm with no explanation.

When we (and other passengers) went back to the Vueling Airlines ticket desk (the wrong way through security and passport control) for an explanation, the Vueling Airlines staff were very rude, defensive, and unhelpful. They initially declined to give us food vouchers (which they must give if flights are over 3 hours late), but eventually gave in. Vueling staff then instructed us to go to a gate at the airport and wait for a Vueling representative, but (surprise surprise) no one turned up. Everyone on the flight was so angry. When we eventually boarded and I queried the delay, the man was short with me and told us â€œFrench air traffic control issuesâ€ â€“ however this was the only major delay from Rome FCO airport, no other flights appeared to be affected â€“so why was only Vueling nearly 4 hours late? In the end, we landed in London Gatwick at 6pm instead of 2.25pm. Afterwards, we read terrible reviews about this airline â€“ many other people have had terrible experiences.

At check in and subsequently on flight we were reassured that all information and assistance would be given at Beijing. We arrived just before 4am - there were no Air China Staff on duty and no directions as to where we should go eventually we found our way to the International Duty Manager's desk which did not open until 5.30am. Once Air China Staff arrived they initially refused to speak to us or offer any assistance. About six hours after arrival waiting going between desks collecting luggage we were given a box of food and a milk drink and checked in on a flight Frankfurt. The flights themselves were cheap adequate and clean Cabin Crew were polite but had difficulty communicating in English. I was disappointed with the poor service shown by Air China airport staff and their lack of honesty in communicating what was to be expected at Beijing especially in view that the situation in Beijing was beyond their control and would not have involved a loss of face despite their poor management and lack of skill in dealing with an adverse situation.,Detractor

"  I was flying from Colombo to Bahrain via Sharjah with my 8 weeks pregnant wife. Firstly, the flight from Colombo to Sharjah was delayed for about 4 hours which led in missing the connecting flight to Bahrain. Any normal airline would at least provide passenger with correct information. At Sharjah airport (which is another part of terrible story), none of the staff had clear information. The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by ""Help Desk"". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight ""any when!!"". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm. I was told that no need to get new boarding pass you will fly on the same boarding pass. At around 5pm, after sitting on chairs at Sharjah airport in miserable and uncomfortable environment, I was given another news. That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just ""wait and we will call you"" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding. This clearly shows the mentality of the airlines where they have made their money and let the poor people be as stand by. After me literally begging the boarding assistant and explaining him my wife situation, he let us go on the plane and luckily, our luggage was also gone through to be on the plane. I appreciate the help of the guys, but this should not have happened in the first place. It was not my fault that the flight was delayed from Colombo. Even the pilot admitted that it was out of their hands. At least offer us a free meal for goodness sake! The general views of public about airline and Sharjah Airport were quite obviously true. Also, the aircraft is not up to the scratch with other competing airlines in region like Gulf, Oman, Saudia etc. There is clearly a hopeless attitude prevailing throughout this airline management.

" This was awful, a rip-off â‚¬1600 of awfulness for a business class return ticket CDG-TLV-CDG. A rip-off because business class from CDG to Tel Aviv is an economy seat with an empty seat next to you. You might get away with that on a short hop within the EU, but on a 4+ hr trip, at this price, it's just not acceptable. It was an overnight flight, and I just assumed, as with the BA flight to TLV, there would be a flat bed. So, it was my fault for not checking. I got an economy seat that barely reclines, perhaps 4-5cm. Needless to say I didn't sleep much. And, in search of another way to get more enraged I checked the price of a flexible economy ticket for the same trip the next day. It was â‚¬700 for a flexible ticket.

"We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"".

Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though. I was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home.

"  The flight from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik with WOW was OK overall. The boarding seemed to be a bit slow, crew was nice at first but seemed to act a bit superior later inflight. The legroom was pretty good for a low cost airline and the plane was rather clean. It arrived on time but it took a while to get to the terminal (using busses). The 2nd leg was pretty crowded, crew was not interested in anything, seat was pretty bad and the legroom was a lot worse than the first flight. At least we got to AMS on time. Overall feeling was good for a low cost airline but not amazing, I will be thinking about it before I use them again considering it is a bit expensive to get a normal size carry on, to get a checked bag and you don't get any water, drinks or food or any kind of IFE. The only really good thing about it was that I got this at an offer and paid a small amount!",Passive
"  My husband and I flew Alaska Airlines from Seattle to Juneau. We were upgraded to the first class because of my husband's frequent flyer's status. There was one main flight attendant (assisted by another occasionally). Staff member was awesome. PA announcements were serious and yet funny so much so I actually paid attention. Service was attentive, sociable and friendly. The food was great. I had been impressed with Alaska Airlines and their services, and still am.",Promoter
"Flew from Rzeszow to Newark via Munich. Flight from Rzeszow to Munich, only 1 hour, was pretty uneventful. Free sandwich and drink. Very small plane, and as a 6 foot tall man, I barely fit in the cabin. The crew was very nice, and spoke fluent English with Polish greetings at the beginning and end of the flight. Flight from Munich to Newark was also phenomenal. Economy class is just like any other, nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, and the service was superb. The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft with a nice feature: the bathrooms are downstairs. We landed 45 minutes earlier, and the transfer was easy. I have been flying with Lufthansa for 4 years now, and it is always easier to fly with them through Frankfurt or Munich rather than drive to JFK just to fly with LOT. Recommend for anyone looking for a safe and reliable trip.",Passive
A330-200 SIN-BNE. Not a pleasant experience. Plane interior looked dated seat was very uncomfortable and leg room was extremely tight. I would have thought this pitch suitable for a short haul route but not long haul. Entertainment was so-so better than some but not up to their competitors standard. Snack after take off was adequate given the time of departure (chicken wrap or pumpkin and fetta) I was just given one and had no idea which it was until biting into it but took a very long time for anything to be served or offered. Breakfast was quite decent although served extremely early before arrival. Service took a long time to complete due to only one crew operating my side of the cabin. There seemed to be a distinct lack of crew throughout the economy cabin. Nothing else was offered between services. Blanket and pillow were good as was amenity pack. What lacks was the seat comfort. Crew were polite and seemed to work hard to compensate for the lack of comfort.,Detractor
My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.,Passive
" Valencia to Milan Malpensa via Madrid. Good aircraft (two flights). High price and luggage not included in price (one 15Kg bag for two passengers). This is not explained in the site when buying ticket. Thus I had to pay 60 Euro for a single bag. In addition, Fee requested for selecting seats. Thus: a return only flight for 2 people was 400E = 200E each. Airlines are profiting of you: luggage allowances and seat selection fees (as well as priority).",Passive
"  Keflavik to London Heathrow. This time I was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft. I was travelling with two companions so I had to find the space for 3 trolley cases. I discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat, and it belonged to a cabin crew. . It was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers, and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process? BA on short haul is simply a budget airline, and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage management. I wasn't impressed by their on board service either. They were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers, even though they were complaint by other passengers.",Detractor
" Flew Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Pot luck with a successful low bid for an upgrade. Check in slowed by difficult passengers intent on shipping luggage far in excess of their allowance with consequential prolonged debate with the local agent. Etihad use a generic lounge at Bangkok which is adequate and no more. Early boarding so ample time to settle into my seat and a prompt departure. Although only six years old the more traditional seating arrangements on the 777 appear dated compared to the 787s, for example, but actually to my personal preference, more private and ample room to stretch out. Cost cutting evident, no amenity kits distributed with only basic eye-pad / ear plugs / flight socks available on request. Food and drink menu limited compared to what was available in the past - no offer of food on demand, the vegetarian fettuccine dry and tasteless. Staff attentive though not proactive with the distribution of water or other soft drinks during the flight. Entertained myself watching live English football and an early James Bond film. No free wifi. On time arrival on an air bridge at Abu Dhabi, which is exceptionally rare for Etihad. Unfortunately a one hour delay recovering baggage due to, as I subsequently discovered, intervention by Customs. Beyond Etihad's control but I was not the only business class customer left scratching their heads as to why their baggage had failed to appear. A little information smooths the feathers.",Passive
" I travelled with Air Arabia from Dammam to Alexandria. Check in counter took 50 SAR for each extra kilo from travellers. I didn't have any extra weight so I was ok but when I arrived to Alexandria airport, I waited in front of luggage claim conveyor for 90 minutes with 15 travellers but we all couldn't find our baggage. We went to Air Arabia representative and he said he received mail from Dammam and 32 luggages were removed from the plane as they were extra weight. I asked them to send my luggages to home but they refused. Then, I said we will come to collect but you have to provide us with transportation but they said no. After that, I asked to reimburse me for what I paid but no use. I called customer service many times and every time they said we will talk to you later. I sent 3 different mails but there was no response. Again, I contacted them through their web page at facebook and asked someone to call me but they gave me more than 10 promises but no one called me. They have the worst customer service ever. Their employees are very rude and don't try to fix their mistakes or give a respect to their customers. Again, I have never seen such customer service all over the world.",Detractor
"  Delta Air Lines flight dreadful in every way. The all-economy-class CRJ200 should have been long retired. DL's (and other US carriers') continued use of this extremely uncomfortable relic on routes well over an hour long boggles the mind. The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps. Take every effort you can to avoid DL on this route and the CRJ200 in general.",Detractor
The worst airline experience I have ever had. Our flight was canceled to go to Puerto Rico on the 24th and Spirit did absolutely nothing to accommodate anyone with alternate routes. We ended up paying $300 more to fly Jetblue and sleeping on the airport floor to fly out the next morning. We kept our flight with Spirit for our return flight on the 27th. Upon arriving at the airport Spirit told me I owed $125 because they over refunded our flight coming in. The supervisor told me she couldn't do anything and that I couldn't board without paying. On top of that the check in bag fees are ridiculously expensive and there isn't any complimentary food or water on the flight. I would not recommend Spirit to anyone and will not ever fly with them again I don't care how cheap they are.,Detractor

NRT-LAX-NRT in Business. Flight attendants friendly and extremely attentive seats not ideal but better than economy. Very difficult to sleep in any position except on your back (not lie flat seats). AVOD is limited. Food is always outstanding out of Narita. The menu you'll get for the Japanese meals is kaiseiki and would cost at least 6-7000 yen if eaten out on the town. However when returning to Japan from abroad the Japanese meals are less than stellar and are inadequate to the level of quality from NRT. They have been offering discounted business class fares that make this a very good value for money. Flew domestic US first class and it just cannot be compared to what you get on ANA business. The lounge in LAX is refurbished and as good as the lounge at NRT. Truly a joy to fly them. The long haul experience with them helps make the travel as painless as possible.,Promoter

The sealed duty free bag worked perfectly and me and my hand luggage were soon inside the Business Class lounge at Shannon, which is lovely - if lacking in food stuff - with delightful staff. Staff on the flight were friendly and Irish breakfast was soon on my tray table. The orange juice had a strange fizzy taste on drinking and sadly would appear that it was off. The new coffee offering also doesn't seem that popular - sharp and bitter tasting and I noticed quite a few customers sending it back untouched. Arrived into Terminal 2 in time and checked bag collection took 10 minutes. A nice flight, despite the breakfast disaster.",Passive

I wanted another drink and buzzed for assistance but nobody came. The inflight entertainment was excellent though but all in all a bad flight - Perth to Dubai. Dubai airport - the Emirates lounge was the best I have ever been in and enjoyed the 4 hour lay over. Dubai to Gatwick - slightly better as the staff were a little more customer focused.

" London to Melbourne via Doha. I found an excellent fare with Qatar so I had to give them a go. My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you. Easily my new second favourite airline.",Promoter
" Ft. Lauderdale to Salt Lake City. Above average US airline. Boarding was disorganized, all that the gate agents cared about was getting first class on before everyone else. However, once we got onboard, the flight attendants provided great care and were very cheerful. The inflight entertainment was amazing, as there were over 100 movies on a domestic flight, although Delta does charge for headphones (you can bring your own free of charge). The food was your average American pretzels & peanuts, but they also provided cookies, which are by far one of the best free snacks offered on a US carrier. The bathrooms were pretty clean and our bag was on the carousel within 5 minutes. Delta is an above average airline and is not as overpriced as American.

Frankfurt to Krakow offered a small pretzel, along with beer, wine, tea, coffee. Warsaw to Munich was delayed but otherwise okay, tasty turkey sandwich with beer or wine. Munich to Newark was also delayed, which was good for me as I otherwise wouldn't have made it because of the delay in Warsaw. Delay was handled well, food vouchers given out.

"I usually enjoy flying Aeromexico, and have had great experiences with them. The problem is that they are hit or miss, and this time is was a great miss. Only one person checking a whole flight in, other counters were open for the rest of Aeromexico red eyes, yet flights to Canada back then had to be checked in by ""specially trained people"" (whatever that means) - which today consisted of only one lady who looked overwhelmed. There was no online check in for this flight for the same reasons cited above. On other occasions on the same flight, Aeromexico had at least three agents, and Air Canada has 4 agents checking in two canada-bound flights. There was no priority check-in for those traveling in Clase Premier. Once I got my boarding pass, I went to look for a floor manager so that he could bring other agents to assist this poor lady, I do not know if it worked. Security went swiftly, personnel at MEX tend to be very friendly. Terminal 2 is way better than terminal 1 in that it feels more spacious and smells less bad. The Premier lounge was OK. It has a modern decor which might look a bit cold . It was quite crowded given the high number of Aeromexico's late night departures (YUL, CDG, NRT, UIO, JFK, ORD etc). Boarding happened in a very organized way, but upon boarding, I realized that as opposed to my previous experiences on this route, this plane was not the newer ones. The male purser was standing at the entrance greeting everyone as if it was a hassle. Seats were in terrible condition and the plane was not particularly clean. Entertainment system consisted of drop down screens that had a terrible resolution, and earphones worked partially. Even in Clase Premier, legroom was appalling. The purser was a bit unfriendly, but the other flight attendant, who kept coming back and forth from the main cabin was outstanding. Once airborne, we were given snacks, and except from the aforementioned flight attendant who I kept seeing over and over again, the rest of the crew proceeded to get paid for sitting down in the jump-seat. Food was served one hour before the estimated arrival time, and its quality was borderline. We were put on holding pattern for nearly one hour but there was no information about this from the flight crew, maybe they thought that nobody would notice. Deplaning went swiftly, but after crossing the air bridge, the glass doors towards the terminal were locked and we had to wait some time for Aeromexico ground staff to come and open it (I suppose it is best to open it before passengers actually deplane). Overall a pretty mediocre-bad experience, it is a shame to receive the same type of service you would receive on a MEX-CUN flight on the largest North American route of the company, and for it to be delivered with such carelessness. Consistency is key in customer service, and it hurts me to see how Aeromexico proudly parades this flaw both in terms of hard and soft products. I would only recommend this airline due to my previous good experiences, but be warned that things might go wrong.",Detractor
Flew from Manchester (UK) to Dubai on EK20 and then from Dubai to Christchurch (NZ) on EK419 (this flight stops at Bangkok and Sydney on the way. Returned from Auckland via Brisbane to Dubai on EK 435 and then to Manchester on EK17. EK419 is on a B777 with the remained on A380's. Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs. Entertainment system is excellent though it's unusual to have adverts on aircraft. Seats were OK a bit wider on A380.

Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean.

They are unable to compensate for the inconvenience and cost that I will incur for having to book another flight so last minute. I understand things change but I have never had a flight change 10 hours unless weather related. There was no explanation for this change besides flight paths have been adjusted. When trying to reach a customer service representative I waited on hold for 3 hours the first day and never got through, and 1 hour the next day to finally get ahold of someone who was simply reading a script and clicking prompts.",Detractor
"  This is regarding the flight from Bucharest to London Luton, scheduled for 3pm. At 9am in the morning the same day, the Wizz website had an update on the flight status i.e. it was 1.5 hours late and would depart at 4.30pm now. I had already paid to check-in a 20kg bag along with my ticket. I had checked in online earlier and had to drop off my check-in bag. I reached the check-in desk at 3pm. The lady said that they had closed the bag check-in and I should take the bag to the gate directly. So, now I had to get my check-in bag scanned as a hand luggage and all my perfumes, etc were thrown away by the airport authorities. When I reached the gate, the Wizz Air lady asked me to pay 65 euros to check-in my bag. I clearly said no and she and her colleague would not let me board the flight. According to them, if the flight had been delayed to 9pm, I should have been at the airport by 1pm to check-in the bag. The flight was further delayed to 5pm! I called the Wizz complaints department and asked them for assistance, to which he replied that I should just pay the money for the bag. After having argued with them for half an hour, I had no choice other than to pay! I ended up paying a total of more than 100 euros for a 12kg bag to get it from Bucharest to London. My bag was cheaper than that! Wizz should be ashamed of the new lows that they go to, to extract money from passengers.",Detractor
 I flew Norwegian from Gatwick to Singapore. It was a great flight as I scored three seats to myself so I could sleep most of the flight. The plane was a Boeing 787-9 and it was very comfortable. The flight was 12.5 hours and I was able to rest for most of the time. I did not buy any refreshments as I bought my own water. I did watch a movie or two on the IFE system. Seats were comfortable. I will fly Norwegian again as they are one of my choices for a low cost carrier.,Promoter
" Flew Havana back to Madrid. The seat is reasonable - aisle access for all seats is good and reasonable space around the seat. I'm a few inches short of six foot, and I could not lie straight and it has a very narrow area at the bottom foot area which is uncomfortable. The food was the worst I'd ever encountered in any class of travel. Basically they put economy class food on china plates. The bread was stale, main was an inedible slab of processed beef with dry rice and the dessert of fresh fruit was actually processed tinned bits. The cabin crew disappear and leave the business cabin for most of the flight. They did the same on the outward flight which was day time. Basically you have to walk around the plane to find someone to give you a drink. They don't respond to the call button. The lounge in Havana is absurd, a smokey den with processed meat and cheese left out without refrigeration. The cabin crew director blamed all this on their Cuban supply chain. Having had good food in Cuba everywhere this seems unfair to blame the Cubans, more likely cost cutting at the hands of Willy ""the slasher"" Walsh - ex CEO of BA who now runs Iberia. Would recommend use Air France or Virgin for Cuba.",Passive
"  This airline is terrible. In taking a simple flight from London Gatwick to Stockholm Arlanada, they managed to delay both my flight out and returning. The customer service lines are also closed on a Sunday, which is interesting because they certainly fly on Sundays so if there is an issue you are on your own. The big issue is the delay (over 3 hours) placed the flight in at 3 am which means there are little to no trains in and I had work in the morning. This airline service is disgusting and I will never fly again. They can't operate well and they don't even have the customer service to remedy their mistakes.",Detractor

The staff on the phone when you can get through are tired and it is easy to see that they very much dislike their jobs. The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best. On a recent flight from Denver going south the attendants did not start the beverage service until we were more than two thirds the way to the destination and did not prepare the cabin for landing until the pilot announced ""Attendants please prepare for landing.""

"  My wife and I just returned from a trip to Portugal that started at Newark Airport on August 6th. We have never experienced such a bad quality of service. After boarding a plane and been ready to take off at 8:25 pm, we had the announcement informing us that we had to go back to the gate due to a computer problem in order for the technicians to fix it. After getting the OK from maintenance, the plane was pushed back, but it stopped a few moments later. After another 30 minutes waiting, we got the announcement from the cabin telling us that the plane had to go back to the terminal because of the same problem. Back at the gate we were told to disembark and take all our belongings because it would take at least a couple of hours to fix the problem. A few minutes later the crew starts leaving the plane and we asked why? The lady says: nobody told you yet? The plane is only leaving at 7:00 am because the crew already used the hours and the pilot can't fly the plane. Then the announcement comes from the counter, but they also tell us that there are no hotels in the area to take everybody, so we will have to stay in the terminal. What about food? A $10 voucher when a sandwich costs $9:99. The night was over. Let's board again and be on the way to Lisbon. We had to wait for another 2 hours, in the plane, for the paperwork from maintenance to clear the work that had been done overnight. We finally took off at 9:30 am, 12 hours later. Just out of curiosity: United claims to be one of the biggest airlines and doesn't have another plane and a crew on standby to respond to this kind of situations? We didn't see one single supervisor in 12 hours.",Detractor

Rude and unhelpful check-in staff, rude and abrupt staff at gate, flight attendants were not friendly and avoid the food at all costs as it looked very old and re-heated quite a few times. The seats were very uncomfortable and the plane was an old and dirty one.

I have only flown 3 times in the past 3 weeks. The agents at the counter don't help with much at all. The ground handling is very slow. At a small airport like MBS with 3 united flights a day, you should not have to wait for ramp staff to come outside and meet the plane.

" We were very disappointed in United Airlines! When we got to our gate at Salt Lake airport at 4pm there were travelers that had been waiting since 9am due to aircraft maintenance, (a hydraulic seal). It didn't delay our flight but put a bad taste in our mouth right from the beginning. The customer service on ground and in the air was just OK. After we boarded all the TV screens were flashing DirecTV propaganda. Saying to swipe your card now and then later saying it was $5.99 for flights under 2.5 hours and $7.99 for flights over 2.5 hours. But they offered a *very generous* discount of $2 each if you swipe the same card on 3 or more screens. They advertise that they have free wifi though! So we connected and downloaded their app with no problem. But after selecting a movie and pressing watch, it makes you enable airplane mode in case of a connection interruption. But after doing so and pressing watch again, it says it can't connect, the same thing happened on our return flight. Which I'm sure forces or tricks people into paying for the DirecTV, which was very glitchy and the sound quality was terrible. So I'm glad we didn't end up paying for that. We landed 10 minutes late and our connecting flight was on the other side of O'Hare and we had 15-20 minutes to get there. We got to the gate with 5 minutes to spare after running the whole way. On our return flight, there were tons of people in the gate room waiting because of another aircraft maintenance delay. This caused us to have to move gates which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. Our flight was also delayed about 30 minutes. When we boarded the cabin it was very hot and stuffy and barely went away by the end of the flight. We were miserable the whole time. Needless to say their airplanes are not properly maintained and are way out of date, (they still had an ashtray in the bathroom). Compared to Delta, United couldn't be worse. Even Southwest and Frontier are better. 10 or 20 years ago all of this might not have even mattered. Can we say misappropriation of funds? In short, we will never be flying United Airlines ever again.",Detractor
JFK-ICN A380 r/t and KUL-ICN B777. Standard Asian service with mainly female crew FA. They have beautiful traditional uniform and polite service. All efficient with English. The 380 plane obviously new and clean. Many movie and TV channels but lacked channels for my six year old. Food was okay and nothing to shout about last meal was 4-5 hours prior to landing. No local drinks to sample except for tea. Seats in Economy are never good for long flights and my back started to ouch after the flight.

"  Hong Kong to San Francisco with Cathay Pacific. Work trip, so had to take the seat offered me. I took the window seat in the emergency row bulkhead behind the wing. 777-300 is a big enough plane that overall the cabin felt roomy and even elegant. Suspecting that I would be experiencing a tedious 14 hour flight, I didn't have high hopes, but the seat width was adequate, and nobody was seated next to me. I could stretch out. Cabin crew was courteous and attentive, but they didn't really seem to make much eye contact. Don't remember too many in flight announcements. Cabin overall quiet and comfortable. Plenty of good movies and games. Lots of newspapers. The only negatives I could observe were the bathrooms and the very very cold air coming out of the emergency slide door. I don't know where it comes from, but it was a constant draft once we got to cruise and I had to place my backpack there to prevent getting frostbite. Disembarked very quickly and even though we were all tired it was all smiles and not much trash. Very well maintained airline.",Promoter
"I flew Spirit this past weekend from Las Vegas to Chicago round trip. After the first flight I had decided that the cheap prices are overall not worth it because of the additional baggage prices and seating prices. I was notified 2 hours before they advise you to arrive at the airport (especially ORD airport in Chicago) that my flight was cancelled and when I called and asked why, they stated ""staffing issues"". I called and the only thing Spirit offered was a flight the next day and a $50 voucher (to be used within 2 months). I spoke with 2 people because I got hung up on and a manager, all of whom could do nothing for me. The higher up manager I was told would call me at 5:30 pm today never called. All of this has been completely unacceptable. So for these reasons I will never fly Spirit again. They have a lot of room for improvement.",Detractor
"Consistency on the ""soft product"" seems to be the biggest problem with CX. I flew CX Business Class on 12/26 then CX First Class on the return flight on 12/31. On the outbound flight the crew was pretty good. No matter how hard I try I just can't get used to the ""ignore you unless you push the call button"" service approach. Having said that I thought the attendants in biz made a few passes through the cabin to see if passengers needed anything. On the return flight in first there was one attendant that was great! The other was somewhere between ""meh"" and annoying. She was determined to get my meal order right away despite the fact I told her a few times that I wasn't quite ready to eat. It wasn't just an unobtrusive ""ready to order yet?"" It was ""I need to get this meal prepared!"" (presumably so she could then relax). I think she came back 4 or 5 times and pushed for the order! Finally I just gave in! Anyway overall CX is pretty good. My problem is that with their reputation comes high expectations and it's almost impossible for them not to disappoint in some way. Really the food and drinks are a cut above almost any other airline and the hard product - the seat - is outstanding.",Passive

"  Stuttgart to London with British Airways. How things have changed. Passengers now queue at gate as with easyJet or Ryanair, rather than sitting and waiting to be called. Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what. Cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced, probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of British Airways to a budget airline. How visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offer. Once that was out of the way, the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley, chatted, and munched away at the spare food from the Business Class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. Directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside them. Everything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued. And this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left. So, no, I won't be flying them again unless all other options fail.",Detractor

The legroom was ample compared to similar aircraft from other airlines that I had flown. Inflight entertainment from drop down cabin screens. The cabin crew were courteous, but unable to communicate English fluently. The meal was served shortly after take-off plus drinks and hot beverages. The second leg from Shanghai Pudong was an older version A320 with classical seat and limited seat pitch. I found it difficult to move my leg and any movement is restricted. A big disappointment as it was not equipped with in-flight entertainment. Inflight meal was slightly better, probably because this is an international flight and provided with ice cream as well.

"  Had my flight delayed out of Oslo to Brussels, which made it very likely that I will miss my connection to Geneva. Tried to find someone to help at Oslo airport, but there was no one from Brussels Airlines and their alliance partner SAS (although serving other members of the alliance) did not have an agreement with Brussels Airlines. I then called their customer service desk in Belgium, but had no help. All they told me was to find help from the airport even if I told them many times that it did not exist. They told me I will, indeed, miss my connection but refused to suggest an alternative. They actually went as far as telling me that all flights the following morning were fully booked. This turned out to be an outright lie. They also refused to commit to any overnight accommodation. So I boarded their plane in Oslo knowing that I had no connecting flight but without knowing what to do in Brussels. Their transfer desk very easily found me a flight the following morning (note I had been told earlier that all were fully booked) and directed me to a hotel for the night. Finally I got to Geneva in the middle of the following day, as opposed to 22:00 in the evening. I contacted the airline after my arrival. Initially they denied any responsibility as my flight was less than 3 hours late (they only looked at the first leg to Brussels), and now after more than 2 months and numerous emails, they had ""completed their investigations"" concluding that my flight to Geneva was less than 3 hours delayed. Having spent the night in Brussels and arriving some 13 hours late, I found that a very interesting conclusion. Generously, they offered my â‚¬25 as a commercial gesture.

"  London to Bangkok via Kuwait. I feel sorry for Kuwait having unusually bad weather in November, but that is where my sympathy ends. The decision was made the day before we travelled for the government to suspend work at all ministries, state institutions and colleges etc so why the airport remained open was a mystery. We arrived into Kuwait and there was rain - no more than a typical day in London. Our connection time of 2 hours actually lasted 26 hours and we missed the wedding in Thailand that we were travelling for! There is a complete lack of order in this airport, they have a tannoy system and screens outside of the gates that never got used. They did not communicate to the whole airport that it had been closed due to poor weather conditions instead sending thousands of people to 1 transit desk which had zero queuing. No hotels were provided, nor was basic blankets or pillows, a shocking meal of bread and a carton of juice and then cold plane food the next morning. Nobody working there knew what was going on, the airport continued to let in passengers the following day even with the large backlog from the night before. The airport is obsessed with searches, even though you have been stuck in the airport all night each time you went through a gate you and all your belongings were searched, bottles of water you brought in the airport were taken off you. The place sprung leaks all over with the rain, the floor was hazardous and buckets were all around trying to catch the leaking water. No plane that I caught with them left on time, the staff had a too laid back attitude, no one communicated what was going on, you were told to sit down and relax which is not what you want to be told after a 26hour delay in a airport with no sleep, no blankets and rubbish cold plane food! Return journey was equally a joke, landed into a terminal, searched, put on a bus to drive past planes on the runway, searched another 2 times in 15 mins and then put back onto a bus to go to a plane that we had already gone past - what was the point?! Overall I found the service abysmal from start to finish, there is a complete lack of customer service, no concept of communication and I am positively fuming that the decision not to close the airport at the start of weds was not taken which could have prevented a lot of people getting stranded in the airport.

" Midnight flight departing Singapore to London on A380 in economy class, not the favourite way to start a trip. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, although the sheer size of the A380 makes for a busy boarding process.

This configuration has economy and premium economy on the lower deck, and the very premium seats on the upper deck. We were in the 2nd most front row of economy, near to the galley. Seats were relatively comfortable (by Economy standards), with a new styled headrest. The AVOD was presented with a large touch screen, and is now line with the likes of Emirates.

Good range of movies as part of inflight entertainment. Staff and crew were kind. No issues during onward journey. But only the return trip was in such a time that we were boarding past midnight and the staff just skimmed through the rows without really asking every passenger what drink they cared to have.

Stockholm - Helsinki - Tokyo return. We paid a bit extra to sit in the Economy Extra zone. It was well worth the money to get some more legroom and the noise-canceling headphones were very nice. However there is some room for improvement when it comes to the new headrests. The service was alright although on the outbound journey they had two meat options for dinner and nothing else. And the new entertainment system is a great improvement but the movie selection could perhaps be a bit larger. Nevertheless it was a very comfortable trip according to the schedule.,Promoter
 Overpriced airline with no extra service. Paid â‚¬350 for a flight from Innsbruck to Split via Vienna not including hand luggage. I had 2kg overweight (10kg instead of 8kg) and the only option they gave me is pay 40â‚¬ more for one direction (so â‚¬80 in total). Very disappointing service.,Detractor

Used Qantas on 8th May from Cairns to Sydney to connect to Kuala Lumpur for the first time. Was completely surprised by the quality of the service. The flight was on time the staff were really good and professional they served a tasty hot meal and even got a nice ice cream before landing. The inflight service was also good they put a movie and the news after that. For me living in Europe and knowing that most European airlines don't have a nice service in Economy anymore was good to enjoy such a good service as Qantas.,Promoter

"  I have flown with Ryanair very often over the last few months from Edinburgh and Glasgow down to London. The aircraft are clean. The flights are on time and the prices are ridiculously cheap. You can get Edinburgh to London single from Â£9.99 if you book early. I find the staff on board tend to be very pleasant and helpful. The seat is fine, it is certainly not the most comfortable ever but given that they only do short flights this is fine. The only slight annoyance is that there is no seatback pocket to put anything in. Overall I would recommend them highly, I think that the value is much better than BA. Ryanair do not charge for a credit card payment, BA charge Â£5. Ryanair are more frequently on time in my experience, and the prices are often around 1/8 of BA prices. No contest I would choose Ryanair. Stansted as an airport is fine, the security was better before they meddled with it, the staff can be rude, but this is the same for anywhere, the main problem is that other passengers at Stansted are just awful, but once you've been a few times you find the quiet seating areas away from everyone else. Ryanair is a good experience, especially for the price. To sum up it does what it says on the tin. To those reviewers complaining about being charges to check in, this is commonplace now, read the instructions before you book and you'll be fine, its not Ryanair's fault.",Promoter
"JFK-MAD-LHR BCN-MAD-JFK. My expectation was low so the experience was not bad. Business Plus seats between New York and Madrid are not really flat and are not really designed for a tall person. I am 6'2"" and couldn't sleep well at all. Business seats on domestic and inter Europe flights were the same as economy class with the middle seat unoccupied. Flight attendants were inattentive. One female attendant even unplugged the headphone without asking me first while she tried to collect it back. The noise cancellation headphone was cheap and didn't work functionally. Entertainment system was at the lower end of industry standard. There were probably only four new movies available. Food and wines choices very good. Lounge in Barcelona was horrible. Be prepared to pay 10 euros to get towels before heading to the shower. Lounge in Madrid was better but still no hair dryer.

"  Unfortunately, the plane that we were taking had some mechanical problems when it landed from the flight right before us. Not knowing the extent of the repair, they had us all board and then realized that it was going to take longer than they anticipated to fix. So, the captain came out and told us what the problem was and then told us that we could get off of the plane and wait in the boarding areas. Of course, no one was happy about the delay -- BUT, Alaska did everything they could to make our 4.5 hour delay bearable. They gave us meal vouchers to use in the airport ($12 each) and issued each passenger a $100 discount code to be used in the next year. While we waited not knowing what to expect, the airlines and the gate personnel were amazing about keeping us updated. They even took our cell numbers in case we wanted to venture away from the gate areas to personally call with updates. We got regular texts from the airlines - and constant smiles and apologies from the staff. One of the gate personnel, Tiffany, went over and above to make us all feel cared about. She even took our 11 month old grandson and played with him for a little bit to help keep him occupied (at this point, he was already bored with us). We lost 1/2 day in San Diego - but, that's one of the risks of air travel. Hooray to Alaska Airlines and their staff for going out of their way to make a bad situation better!",Promoter
" Delhi to London. I have come to London as a short-term student for 4 months under a fully funded Government of India and British Council Scheme, Newton-Bhabha PhD placement programme.

I called UK office to inquire the same they are saying 'Sorry, we can't issue one' and giving me option to pay 140 pounds to take that 3rd piece of bag. Is it justified to harass a student like this???? I literally have to throw my suitcase alongwith the things in London and go back to India with so called 2 piece allowance. It's my compulsion to travel with Air India because of government funding otherwise I would be the last person to choose this airlines. I must mention the staff is so rude and arrogant to clients that they are not ready to utter options available to us.

Was a problem when the departure gate changed about 20 minutes before departure time and was not easy to find due to works at the departure area at ATH. After we got there, there was a further delay of approximately 30 minutes, which eventually most of it was covered by the pilot and arrived at Barajas T2 only about 10 minutes late.

Was pleasantly surprised by Delta service in Economy class on a round trip between DTW and AMS on Oct. 10 (outbound) and Oct 17 (inbound). Cabin services both ways was attentive throughout the flight - something that some other US-based carriers fail to grasp. The Economy class food was actually tasty and abundant especially on the AMS-DTW flight. Am happy to find a US-based carrier that can hold its own in Economy class against its Euro- competitors. So would definitely recommend Delta service between DTW and AMS as a gateway between the US and Europe - even in Economy the journey is part ot the enjoyment of the overall trip.,Promoter

"  After all of the awful publicity that United received in the months leading up to our flights I was concerned that I had made a terrible choice for our journey from Sydney to Los Angeles. However, my 14 hour economy flight was probably about as enjoyable as any economy flight can be. United flies the lovely new 787 on this route, the air quality is better, the lighting is better and the seats, although they look really small, are actually amongst the most comfortable I have flown on. Video Entertainment is great, although the lack of audio was a bit frustrating, take your phone or Ipad along for this. Wi-Fi for purchase is a fun option to pass the time and costs are reasonable. The food was OK, a meal on departure, a snack in between and then a rubbery egg breakfast before landing in LA. The reality is this was an economy flight, the fare was really really good value. We resisted the constant sales push before the flight to purchase economy plus which does provide extra leg room if you feel you need it, at least with United have this option at a pretty reasonable rate if you feel you need it. By the way, this flight was spot on time as were all of our other United internal flights, boarding and disembarking was smooth as anything.

Check in procedures at both airports efficient and quick with smiles. Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher calibre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles.

"  We were scheduled to fly Air Canada Rouge on December 26, 2016 from Toronto to Varadero, Cuba. The flight was to depart at 0800. This flight was delayed until 1050 because there wasn't a pilot to fly the plane. We boarded the plane at 1015 and sat on the plane for about an hour. There was a maintenance problem with this plane that was discovered as it flew into Toronto. We had to get off of the plane and return to the terminal while they got a different plane. We boarded this different plane at 1230. They then had to rearrange the passenger seating to balance the plane, due to the fact that this was a larger plane. We eventually left Toronto at 1355 instead of 0800. These delays caused us to arrive at our hotel in Varadero at 2030 instead of 1430 which ruined the first day of our vacation.

Premium is great service excellent (same service and food as business).

"  I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket.

My bag got a plastic coverage for better protection free of charge. The food was simple but tasty. More drinks would be welcomed. This airline was better than average.,Passive
" Seattle to Dubai. This was my first time with Emirates and I was expecting much more than this flight delivered. Just going down a short list: I expected better seat comfort, I hoped for more attention from the flight attendants (this was a 14 hour flight with only one visit by a flight attendant in the 14 hrs, that being after they served the meals). There were many, many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally, the food was mediocre at the best. So, what I learned on my first Emirates flight is the experience of air travel with them is no better than Delta or American Airlines.",Passive
One of many business class trips made on China Southern. I must say that the seats on business class are of old design and not as comfortable as some newer designs since it cannot go to 180 degree as yet. The cabin crews were friendly as usual but you can also sense some are really inexperienced. Overall all my flights total 4 of them being Melbourne - Guangzhou Guangzhou - Beijing Beijing - Guangzhou and Guangzhou - Melbourne were all on time. I was happy with the experience.,Passive
Among world class airlines and its 5-star competitors like Cathay Pacific Qatar definitely holds its own. This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while. Overall worthy of being a top international airline and recommended. Will fly (am flying!) with them again.,Promoter
 Phoenix to Colorado Springs. We will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We boarded our plane and once everyone was on we were told that the captain would not be arriving for another two hours and we could deplane it we wanted to. This is not the first incident we have had with this airline! We have used them a few times and have run into delays or mechanical issues every single time no matter where the departure or arrival! Today was the last straw. Don't know when we will be headed home today.,Detractor
" Helsinki to Porto via Lisbon. My checked baggage was damaged and lost on the way from Helsinki to Porto - only one piece of three came through to the final destination at Porto. We had baby strollers and a cabin sized bag and a camera tripod tied firmly into them with cargo straps, but somewhere on the way (presumably at Lisbon) someone had removed the cargo strap and the cabin bag and simply left them out. Upon arriving at Porto airport I filed a lost luggage complaint, which was marked as resolved closed by Groundforce the next day without ever delivering the bag to me - the camera tripod was however found and delivered. Hours of calling around did not get us anywhere - Groundforce says they cannot reopen the lost items ticket even though they made a mistake closing it and it is now TAP Air Portugal's responsibility. TAP Air Portugal initially refused any responsibility but eventually advised to make a complaint of the lost luggage - which we did. It turns out the airline does not proess these complaints, or it may take up to year to do so - during which time nobody is looking for the bag and it might end up sold in an auction before anyone even reads my complaint. Nobody at the airport will look for the bag without an open lost items case and nobody cares enough to reopen my case or open a new one and thus my bag seems to be lost forever because of the process and TAP Air Portugal's complete lack of interest towards customer satisfaction. I did not get my preordered vegetarian on the flight either - the cabin crew just said they were not informed such an order had been placed, although I was able to produce a confirmation from the airline stating it had. So their internal communication is a mess. On social media they just repeat how they will respond as soon as possible or are waiting for a reply from the proper department - in my case for over two weeks now - so if even their internal communication in simple issues takes weeks, one can only guess how bad the situation really is. Long story short - flights often delayed, customer service nonexistent. Your best bet: Take Another Plane, as people say on their Facebook page.",Detractor
"  Helsinki to Singapore via Zurich. This review is mostly on the latest cancellation experience I had with Finnair, which I sent them emails repeatedly on this for 3 weeks however yet to receive a reply (not even a reply to say that my request is being processed/ investigated). So my flight from Helsinki to Singapore was cancelled and I was re-routed with Finnair and Singapore Airlines via Zurich. For the cancellation experience, the ground crew did not inform us on the cancelation until 2 hours after the planned departure time. The ground staff did not provide us information on the new booking arranged for the passengers. We were sent to an airport hotel and I had to call the airline hotline where I only knew about my new booking around 4 am (after calling repeatedly and being put on hold), to only get 1.5 hour sleep before my next flight. The airline also did not honour the confirmed business upgrade on the previous and I was returned back to Economy (this was a big issue since I had neck pain issues and I didn't bring my neck pillow). As for the HEL-ZRH Finnair, the seat pitch was good. The airline provided basic F&B. There was no inflight entertainment or WiFi. Cabin crew service was good but not extra ordinary. I would recommend the flight, however just pray that your flight is not cancelled. I was treated better on LH, SQ and TK during cancellations/ delays",Passive
DFW-ABQ on Aug. 8 and return ABQ-DFW on Aug 15 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Flights nothing special but OK given the limitations on US domestic flights - obviously older planes but comfortable and cabins looked fresher than expected so obviously well maintained/renovated. Catering in First for both 100 minute flights during meal hours was a pack of pretzels and full bar service. White wine on the evening flight to ABQ was warm Chardonnay. FA's were friendly and efficient on the on the flight to ABQ and rather uninterested on the flight back to DFW. Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication. Return flight eventless and on time. So nothing special but no major problems either. All in all a very average experience.,Passive
PNH-BKK on a AB6 and BKK-CDG on a A380. PNH-BKK was in Business and whilst only 1 hour was a great flight. The seats are comfy the service was good and the fact they could serve a hot meal and drinks in less than an hour was impressive. On arrival in BKK we were met and escorted directly to the First Class lounge which was great as not sure I would have found it otherwise! The service in the lounge was great very attentive. Also escorted from here to the next flight. The A380 suites are very comfortable. Service on-board very attentive and food excellent. Not the greatest of movie selections but a minor grumble. One oddity was that that if you wanted to use an arrival lounge you had to have requested it prior otherwise your into the Star Alliance lounge which is a bit of a zoo. Would definitely fly them again.,Promoter
"Flew from Manchester to Toronto. If you have an alternative then take it. I take about 20 flights a year on various airlines. Air Canada rouge has been the worst. The food is poor, its poor on Air Canada too. There's no TV, you have to take your own iPad or similar, and there's nowhere to charge it. They even charge you for using your own iPad and your own electricity. All alcohol is paid for and tickets are not cheap. It's a budget airline at premium prices. Easyjet could teach them a thing or two. I only used the flight to avoid having to fly via London. They should take the e off the end of rouge and put an h there. Air Canada Rough, much closer to the facts.",Detractor
"Consistency on the ""soft product"" seems to be the biggest problem with CX. I flew CX Business Class on 12/26 then CX First Class on the return flight on 12/31. On the outbound flight the crew was pretty good. No matter how hard I try I just can't get used to the ""ignore you unless you push the call button"" service approach. Having said that I thought the attendants in biz made a few passes through the cabin to see if passengers needed anything. On the return flight in first there was one attendant that was great! The other was somewhere between ""meh"" and annoying. She was determined to get my meal order right away despite the fact I told her a few times that I wasn't quite ready to eat. It wasn't just an unobtrusive ""ready to order yet?"" It was ""I need to get this meal prepared!"" (presumably so she could then relax). I think she came back 4 or 5 times and pushed for the order! Finally I just gave in! Anyway overall CX is pretty good. My problem is that with their reputation comes high expectations and it's almost impossible for them not to disappoint in some way. Really the food and drinks are a cut above almost any other airline and the hard product - the seat - is outstanding.",Passive
"Ercan to London Stansted via Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen. Pegasus ground staff at Ercan were helpful. My return flight was a morning flight, we were greeted politely by the cabin crew, they assisted me to put my hand luggage in the overhead bins. The flights were comfortable and both take offs from Ercan and Sabiha Gokcen and landings in Sabiha Gokcen and in Stansted went smoothly that my toddler slept through them. The safety video was quite cute with the superheroes. The negative thing I can think of is that some of the cabin crew are a bit difficult to understand. I had to ask my husband who speaks fluent Turkish to translate some of the things they said when they spoke the announcement in Turkish after the English. Apart from that there is really nothing else to fault with the airline. I see a lot of reviews complaining about leg room, plane size, if you want high service then spend more money on an airline who can cater for all your needs.",Promoter

I'am generally use Turkish Airlines and first time this is the first time I see more than one managing problem during check-in and flight. Check-in attendants was much more slower than my other trips and they gives people wrong information. They have no idea about seat layout of aircraft and nobody don't accept and try to solve any kind of problem. During flight, you can feel the differences between cabin crew, Turkish Airlines don't educate their new flight attendant like they used to. I hope these problems will be short term and Turkish Airlines back to their old days.",Passive

My wife and I flew from Sydney to Denpasar (Bali) return on an A330. Aircraft's were modern and clean and tidy inside. The cabin crew were all well groomed polite and gave excellent service. Our flights left 10-25 mins late but this delay was mostly made up on route. Before takeoff given drinks and meals were a nice quality and nice quality. On the return journey they had run out of choices by the time they got to our seats but the cabin crew made sure that we got first pick of the croissants and breads. Another really good service that Garuda offer is on board passport control. 2 immigration officers travel on the flight and do the passport and immigration procedures on the aircraft during the flight and Garuda collect the fee on their behalf. This service as far as I know is only between Australia and Indonesia. This made the process of passing through the airport quick and efficient. Areas where I think they could improve further: My wife and I found the seat backs to be a little hard on the return journey I would like to see the inflight info (speed location etc - map) on our seat back screens. No web check in was available and I would like to see the option of selecting seats at booking. I found it annoying and inconvenient having to be taken between the aircraft and Denpasar terminal by bus and would like to see Garuda use the jet bridges. Would I fly with Garuda again? Yes!

The boarding passes we printed out at DFW Airport showed that the flight from DFW to TYR originally scheduled at 6pm was delayed to 8pm. We still went to the gate to see if the delay was changed. The monitor showed that the flight was delayed to 8pm. After we returned to the gate at 7pm we were told the flight left at 6.30. There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car.

" Orlando to Norfolk. The flight attendants were probably some of the nastiest people I've ever encountered. There were two main flight attendants. The first thing I noticed was one greeting the customers. I was sitting right in front of him, when I noticed he would giggle or make faces at the different people walking by. I didn't think this was too big of a deal, just a case of immaturity. Then, a single black mom and her child boarded and sat in front of me. This seems to have caught the other FA's attention - she asked the mother how old the child was, and she replied â€œ1, turning 2 tomorrow. Why do you ask?â€. The FA said, â€œshe looks a lot bigger than you say she is, but okayâ€ and walks away. From that point on, it seems the FA is constantly picking on the single mother. 5 minutes after the encounter, the FA says â€œyour baby can't be in a seat, she has to be in your lap if she isn't officially 2 yetâ€. The mother complies, but mumbles something under her breath. â€œIs there an issue?â€ the FA snaps, staring at the single mother and her child. Another 5 mins has passed, and the FA walks up to the mom again. â€œYour seat can't be reclinedâ€, and she reaches over and adjusts it half an inch, without asking of course. Another 5 mins, the FA complains that she can't see the Mom's seatbelt, even though she clearly had it on. This consisted almost the entire two hours, the FA constantly calling out the single mother for the smallest reasons. As the FA was in the back talking loudly about all the bloody mary's She intends to drink for her birthday, the mom fell asleep. As we were fixing to land, the other FA was walking up and down collecting trash, before stopping at the sleeping mom and daughter, pointing and smiling. The FA walks up, â€œdon't worry, I'll handle itâ€ and she takes off her gloves. She pokes the mother, â€œWe're about to land, you might want to hold your babyâ€, she says, and afterwards, running off to the bathroom to wash her hands. The other FA goes to the back and I can immediately hear them giggling again. I felt so disgusted after the flight, even more disgusted with myself for not saying anything. This was clearly a case of bullying, and the flight attendant was clearly picking on the black mother and her child. It made me sick to my stomach. That was my experience, hopefully anyone flying with Frontier has more decent flight attendants.",Detractor

One of the passengers a lady with a small child 15 months old was doing an admirable job of keeping the little girl happy. On a 4.5 hour flight this is a nearly impossible task.

I flew MAD-MIA - it was my first intercontinental with Iberia. I was led to believe this is one of their best routes in terms of aircraft and service. That may be the case but compared to other airlines the service and product were poor. A new aircraft but entertainment system had very poor selection of movies for such a long flight - almost nothing current. The navigation was slow and system crashed twice. The worse thing was the staff. The flight attendants on the few occasions one sees them are rude. They assume that UK or US citizens can't speak English and on three occasions I heard they say very rude comments in Spanish to non Spanish speakers - sarcastic rude and unhelpful. There was no pre-flight safety check and again before landing no cabin check. We landed with people not belted and seats reclined. I rarely fly economy but on this occasion it was part of a special priced global ticket. It just made me feel that in an emergency it would be hard to get out of the aircraft as people were not ready for landing. I would imagine that on an emergency the staff would be unreliable. An airline that does not take safety seriously shouldn't be flying. Almost all of the 9 hours the staff was on the back galley talking. One was smoking one of those vapour cigarettes - not seen that on duty. When I asked for a glass of water they three flight attendants said they were on their break and pulled the curtain. I had one drink in 9 hours served with the meal. Iberia is a disgrace. In short don't fly with Iberia - poor attitude poor product and questionable safety procedures (or lack off).,Detractor

"Rouge is a great disappointment. Air Canada has labelled it as a ""leisure"" airline which is code for poor service cramped seating space and price gouging. The number of ""Air Canada"" flight routes are rapidly dwindling with the carrier moving routes to Rouge service. Last week I flew Toronto return to Tampa. The seating pitch is cramped. The passenger next to me continually had their head in my lap while trying to access their under seat storage. When the passenger in front fully reclined their seat I briefly thought about offering them money to return their seat back so that I could have a few more inches of space. The entertainment system is not well thought out. Passengers on both my flights were not using headphones to watch their devices. Volume levels were on high to compete with the jet noise and their hearing aids. With the in-flight entertainment system headphones are required to access the entertainment sound. None of the flight attendants addressed the lack of headphone use issue but instead preferred to ignore it. The entertainment selection on the Rouge app is not appealing. Very sad is that the cost to fly Rouge in May was more than 40% higher than to fly Air Canada less than a year ago with the same advance booking time. I will not fly Rouge again.",Detractor

When I told her I recognized her from my outbound flight on 4 Aug she was thrilled that I recognized her. Seats were spacious great leg room but I would have appreciated another 2 inches of recline to make sleeping that more comfortable. The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks. They need to improve on their snack quality which mainly consists of processed food. A few choices like fruit and sandwiches would have been nice.

" Newark to Hong Kong. This is the airline with the worst customer service that we have ever experienced. We were travelling to attend a wedding. We drove 3 hours to the airport with no indication of the airline being delayed or diverted. After parking and arrived at the departure hall, we were approached by the crew members that our flight has been diverted to Toronto due to weather. We were asked to wait for further information. We arrived around 10:00 pm with departure time at 1:30 am. After 1.5 hour wait, we were told the flight has been canceled and we were to call the numbers on the sheet of paper that we were handed out. We were appalled! There are around 10 CX uniformed employees there and were not doing any re-booking or issuing any vouchers or do anything but to tell us to call and keep calling. Of course we couldn't get through. After trying for a while with no success, we decided to drive back as there was no point waiting at the airport since no one could help us there. Couldn't get through until 3 am in the morning and they said there are no flights available for us to reach our destination on time. We had to cancel and still waiting to see if we can get refunded. Called my family to convey the bad news to them. Our kids were extremely disappointed as they were supposed to be the flower girl and boy. We had a luggage of kids favor to hand out at the wedding as well. Our family had to seek alternatives last minute. I cannot believe it with my own eyes that this is happening.

"  Travelled with my husband and three children from Oslo to Melbourne on Emirates tickets, with the Dubai to Melbourne leg operated by Qantas. Stark contrast in quality of service, food and cabin fitout between Emirates and Qantas. Qantas staff seemed preoccupied with getting passengers to sleep as quickly as possible above all else, including requests for a bottle to get my tollder settled (grumpy, exhausted 3 year olds aren't conducive to getting a cabin full of people to sleep!). Kids weren't allowed to change seats before take off despite ample unoccupied seats after boarding was complete. Staff did however allow an adult male to change to an empty row of 4 seats before take off. On previous Emirates flights the kids seemed to be given at least a fair chance of occupying spare seats therefore increasing the possibility that they would sleep (which benefits the entire cabin). Kids meal on Qantas was a bread-like tube filled with veges and tomato sauce and a packet of Smarties. Contrast this with Emirates: hot bowl of macaroni cheese, rolls, a dessert, a drink, and a box full of snacks like small chocolate bars, crackers, crisps, and a small toothbrush kit. Entertainment system on Qantas was measly compared to Emirates with very few family movies and a smaller screen. Noticeably less leg room (my husband is 6 foot 4). In terms of service quality - only one staff member in our section seemed happy to be on the flight and conversed with our kids beyond 'Hi mate'. Qantas should be aware that (over)use of the word 'mate' doesn't make up for a lack of genuine care in making a kid's 13 hours in a confined space surrounded by snoring adults as comfortable as possible. On Emirates I felt totally comfortable asking for extra drinks, crisps etc for the kids (to reduce their loud 'I'm hungry' complaints). On Qantas I soon realised that these requests were treated as big extra workloads by the staff. On the plus side, my husband enjoyed the snack bar at the back of the plane.",Detractor
 Philadelphia to Milwaukee. This is the worst airline ever and customer service is the worst.

"I am a business traveler with over one million lifetime miles spread over several airlines. I am a Frontier Summit member and have had that status over the last several years. In the early days I found the airline to be of good quality. Under the new management Frontier has plummeted in my estimation under this guise of ""low cost"". First it is not low cost when the ""nickel and dime"" charges are added in. The under-staffing at my home airport (DIA) and the various regional airports is quite apparent. If one talks to staff or flight attendants the low morale becomes apparent. Needless to say I have a few award miles to spend and then it is adiÃ³s to Frontier. What a shame that an airline that was of reasonable quality has been driven down by these new owners.",Detractor

  easyJet flight from Majorca to Gatwick was delayed by 4 and half hours. Our taxi driver back in England found out before we did. Was told at the airport it was due to a plane mechanical at first. Then told no staff so had to borrow staff from Belfast and Luton and send them over on an empty plane. Got told at the airport we were all entitled to Â£250 each. The lady at the desk even rang her manager to double check. Now back home being told were getting nothing as it was extraordinary circumstances and we are entitled to nothing. They gave us food vouchers. However the plane had basically no food onboard.,Detractor
This is the second time I have flown United and it will be the last. The first time all the planes were late and we kept getting bumped to later flights. When we did arrive the luggage did not and it took four days to get the luggage. The second time I flew first class. After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions. In the future I will be flying Delta. We flew Delta last year and it was a much different experience.,Detractor

Customer service is lacking big time. I had a feeling that nobody from the crew is willing to help with anything. I did not see a single smile from the cabin crew during the whole flight not even at exiting the aircraft upon arrival. Cabin crew appears to be unwillingly performing their job duties. They assume by default that all of their passengers are Polish and will speak English only once you tell them several times that you don't understand Polish - some of them had to be told on 3-4 occasions the same thing about language - is that ignorance, I don't know.",Passive

Aircraft was clean and spacious with 2-2-2 seat configuration in business class, but the seat was not comfy. You could lie flat but lower part of the seat dropped down and legs did not get enough support. I could not sleep well in this seat. FA staff on PVG-DOH flight professional and helpful while DOH-LHR were superb. Food on PVG-DOH looked pretty good but tasted dull. On DOH-LHR, I ordered a light salad with scallops but got octopus served. Transit security check at DOH was messy : no Fast Track at all even though Fast Track was clearly signed.

"Our Lufthansa flight to London Heathrow was supposed to leave at 7 am from Frankfurt, but ground staff announced it would be delayed because of de-icing. Although this might be a standard procedure for large airports in winter, especially for the second half of january whene traffic is not very high, it took surprisingly long to board the plane, and ground staff did not provide very clear indications for boarding sequency. We took off from Frankfurt at 8.19am. Overall the flight was comfortable, with a comfy seat and little turbulence. We spent some time circling over London before landing at Heathrow.

"  Shanghai to JFK New York. I flew 8 flights with China Eastern between October 16 and November 2, six of these domestic flights within China on Shanghai Airlines, which is owned by CE. On the international flights planes were new and clean, with seating you'd expect in economy class. Meal and drink service were fine, but food quality was lacking. Noodles were extremely greasy and fish was very fatty, not appetizing. Another dinner consisted of eggplant (again greasy) and rice, with a side dish of a cold white pickled vegetable, plus a packet of 8 saltine crackers. No cheese or anything else with the crackers. Water melon for dessert. Inflight entertainment was odd, perhaps chosen solely with Asian passengers in mind. Baggage handling : the outbound trip checked my bag from JFK to my destination in Guiyang, with change of plane in Shanghai. In Shanghai I learned that my flight to Guiyang had been cancelled because of weather so about 4:00PM I and 10 others in my group were taken to a hotel about 15-20 minutes from the airport. At 9:30PM our tour guide knocked on each hotel room door to tell us that CE required us to return to the airport to claim our bags. Why? ""If you leave it overnight it may get lost."" We went. After Guiyang we headed to Wenzhou, again via Shanghai. We arrived in Wenzhou on a morning flight but bags did not. When would they arrive? ""Maybe tomorrow."" This seemed strange since there were two more flights the same day. In fact the bags reached our hotel shortly after midnight, probably arriving on the second of the two remaining flights that day. My TSA-approved lock was missing, but bag contents were complete. These experiences did not raise confidence in China Eastern's ability to handle luggage. End of my trip involved a flight from Guilin to Shanghai leaving Guilin at 12:10PM on November 2. At dinner November 1st our tour guide received a call informing us that our flight had been cancelled ""due to a change to winter schedules on November 1."" We were re-scheduled on a November 2 flight leaving at 7:30AM, the only flight of the day. This required leaving our hotel at 5:30AM. If winter schedules go into effect on November 1, why did CE sell us a ticket for November 2 using ""summer schedules""? And why was our guide only notified of the change the night before the flight? No traveler in our group received any email notification of the schedule change. We can only thank our tour guide that she had contacts that informed her of the change",Detractor

I was asleep when the meal was served but awoke when the CA were approx. 4 seats in front of me (serving from front to rear area). They saw me, but didn't serve me at all.

"  Krakow to London. Got us there fine. My main issue is the food service. I was sat in Row 21, probably 3/4 of the way back. It was an evening weekday flight,so everyone tired & hungry. Their new M&S service was a disaster. The flight was just over 2 hours. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets! They had already run out of sandwiches / hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored). Have to say this services is no better than Easyjet & I will think twice about travelling with BA. If it wasn't paid for by work I would not have travelled with them. The service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier.",Detractor
"  Buffalo to Orlando. After a preliminary email stating the flight was delayed by 2+ hours, the gate employees were unable to provide any useful updates. The 7pm arrival finally showed up an hour later and passengers disembarked at 8:30pm. First we were told maintenance was delayed for clean up of the recent arrival so we were delayed indefinitely. I'd say they never intended to depart. At 10:30pm we were finally told the flight was canceled and as stated there were two options. Rebook with them or $400 for another airline ticket. Since they have one daily departure from Buffalo, I might leave by next week! That's if they ever reimburse us for the new airline tickets.

"Very glad to finally have nonstop service to and from JFK. The service on the return flight from JFK to Tucson in Economy Preferred seating was non existent. Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC.

SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!,Passive

And this connection was a pleasant one in both directions, the Iberia lounge at T4 MAD is equal or better than what can be found in competing hubs. There was ample legroom in the front section of the cabin, and the seats were okay, even if their recline is limited. I can do without IFE as long as there is enough space to work on my computer. Both flights from and to BRU offered the best warm meals I had in the last ten years on a European flight of such duration. A menu card was provided, and the choice was meat or pasta. I had a veal hamburger one way and a steer eye fillet steak the other way, with a quality and a quantity you expect on a long haul flight. They came with a salad, cheese, cake, and there was also a good selection of decent airline wines, followed by coffee and cognac. My suitcase was not on the carousel at my arrival in Malaga because they had left it in Brussels. I reported thus to their missing bags office. I was first told that my suitcase was in Mallaga, and I wasted time queuing before filling a form and getting neither an explanation (except that the bag was still in Brussels), nor any sort of assistance. They promised it would be delivered â€œmananaâ€, but this translated at the end into a two-day delay. This was under the unpleasant physical pressure of a Guardia Civil member they called because another passenger was complaining loudly for the same reason, and I filled a complain in writing about the event. At the time of writing this back in Belgium (seven days later), I am still waiting to hear from Iberia customer service department about my claim and written request for compensation. On the phone they just told me that they will reimburse my expenses (but did not explain how), and I shall not push the matter further because the amount of what I bought is far below the value of my time to get a problematic refund.",Detractor
Flew HKG-CDG-HKG Premium Economy Aug/Oct 2013 with a stop in Istanbul. Unfortunately Istanbul - CDG leg was in economy as no Premium available.

" I found an unbelievable low fare from NYC to Chicago for under $100 round trip and decided to take advantage of this deal. I was able to select available seats in advance at no extra charge. I didn't expect much from this relatively short flight. The cabin was clean, and it looked full to me. It took on time, no delays on the return flight either. Each seat had IFE. Complimentary non alcoholic beverages were served and they had snacks for purchase but I don't think anyone bothered to buy anything on board of this 2 hour flight. Overall I'm satisfied with the service.",Passive

I am trying to claim from insurance but they need to know the exact reason for flight cancellation,and Air New Zealand customer service email says they are busy at the moment and may take up to 20 days to reply.

I have travelled EVA many times usually Premium Economy occasionally in Business and in general seats are comfy food is decent and staff is very pleasant. My complaint is about the website which is one of the worst I have ever encountered and far and away the worst airline website I have ever used. Maybe the Chinese language site works better? The English site is horrible. It took me hours to figure out and book flights. Then I couldn't select seats so I called the 800 number and was told that aisle seats were requested for me. Today 3 days before flight I got an e-mail inviting me to select seats on the website. Trying to log in using confirmation # and name (exactly as on ticket) and they couldn't find my name. Logging in with frequent flyer number and password and the system is down please try later. Please EVA upgrade the website!,Promoter
" This has to be the worst service/food/treatment I've ever experienced. First off the food was terrible. I couldn't even eat any of it and it seems that was a common thing for the people around me. But the staff do not know how to speak English. They know key phrases and a few words but god forbid you have a problem because you wont receive any help because they wont understand you. If you loose your luggage, your flight is canceled, there are any changes they wont be able to explain anything or help you in anyway. This airline is cheaper for a reason and I highly recommend going with a different company because if you have any problems or questions you're in trouble. My flight to JFK was canceled and then the staff were actually yelling at me just saying ""you wait 10 hours!"". No explanation, no we're sorry, just yelling in Chinese and finger pointing. Don't get me wrong, you'll get to the place a little late but in one piece. But just expect to be treated like an animal.",Detractor
" Due to TAP's inability to cope with a fuel shortage in Portugal, my flight was delayed for an hour. I left the boarding area because they initiated the boarding procedures and then inadvertently stopped it leaving passengers looking at the ceiling and only informed by an almost codified internal sms announcing the delay. Almost didn't make it to the gate again as they suddenly re-opened the boarding process. Had to run through the crowded corridors to get there still on time to board. Needless confusion of an airline that still has much to learn. The problem is until they are funded by the Portuguese Republic and the EU, being one of the last still semi-public airline corporations in the world, they'll do whatever they like, the consequences being the paid taxes by Portugal citizens, unfairly making up for their annual losses. Lisbon airport getting older by the day and needing a revamp and expansion urgently. Improved cleaning wouldn't hurt either and it applies to TAP planes too. For the rest, nice and attentive cabin crew but repetitive and boring catering.",Detractor

Been a Qatar frequent flier for a couple of years. Gold card holder and choose Qatar as the preferred airline. Generally extremely Professional and experienced crew. In recent times have noticed that the quality of Food can be much better. I generally choose AVML as the Choice. On the last flight from DOH-OSL I was served a chicken sandwich instead of vegetarian. Been served Pasta as AVML on one of the flights. Food quality is one thing that I believe that QR has dropped in. Customer service is still good (even if an occasional mistake happens).

My business partner and I flew Auckland/Queenstown on 20 May returning the next day. I don't normally comment on domestic flights but these two flights need recognition for the stellar service provided by Air New Zealand.

" Flew London to Bengaluru. British Airways have reached a new low. Flight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working to replace a pin. Two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne. Cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful. The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery.

The most horrible experience onboard the new 787 Dreamliner yesterday I flew from Bogota - New York in Business Class and I was very disappointed with this new aircraft!

"  CX889 from Vancouver to Hong Kong then CX703 from Hong Kong to Bangkok. Due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft, the flight from Vancouver was delayed by approximately 5 and a half hours. Check-in in Vancouver was a frenzy, with ground staff breaking the news to the passengers at half past midnight while trying to rebook as many passengers onto other flights (which were also extremely full, due to Spring Break). I have once stated this in one of my reviews, but it seems as if the ground staff in Vancouver are deteriorating. I was given told to ""go home and come back at 4.30am in the morning"". Dull responses such as ""We don't even know if the flight will leave. If the plane has a problem, we'll have to cancel the flight. But we won't know until 6.30am in the morning."" It was 1 in the morning, like how am I supposed to get home at this time? I was completely stressed out and realized I was going to miss my connecting flight to Bangkok. Nonetheless, I made my way to the lounge where the staff were much more understanding and tried their best to get us settled in before our flight. I was offered a bowl of noodle soup and blankets. Hence, I was able to grab a 4-hour nap before the flight was announced to be operational. I also managed to grab a shower before boarding which immensely helped me with my bitter mood from the night before. Vancouver to Hong Kong on the Oneworld livery aircraft. Crew was flawless and worked hard, non-stop, throughout the trans-Pacific flight, offering drinks and cup noodle every half an hour midflight. Arrived Hong Kong at almost noon time (originally scheduled for a 7am arrival) to an army of ground staff handling misconnections. I was rebooked onto the 8pm flight to Bangkok, and Cathay gave me a hotel room and a meal in the airport hotel as a compensation. The staff that assisted me offered every communication tool possible for me to communicate with my parents, who were waiting for me in Bangkok, as well as apologizing several times for the delay. I must say, although frustrated, I was impressed by how well all the staff in Hong Kong handled the misconnections, unlike the ones in Vancouver that weren't willing to help since they ""couldn't confirm if the flight was leaving or not."" (P.S. I didn't even receive my luggage tags upon check-in in Vancouver and the Hong Kong staff managed to get it for me in seconds). Hong Kong to Bangkok on a full Airbus A330. Cabin crew were trying their best to serve to everyone's needs, but with all seats in Economy filled on the flight, there were moments where I felt the service was a bit robotic.

I called their customer service line and was told the ticket needed to be split into two different tickets, I was sent a confirmation code by email to allow me to change her reservation. I used that and looked to see what my options were and one of them was change the date of the flight and receive miles credited back to me. When I tried to log in later to do that I got an error message saying she had to create her own account. I called in to ask why she had to create an account when I booked it using my miles and I was told it's because it couldn't be modified without her creating an account.

Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable.

Flight attendants were very friendly but had to cope with rude passengers who simply don't understand what one piece of hand luggage means. Flight was full and so where the overhead bins within 10 minutes. Passengers came with 3 bags and were yelling at the flight attendant that they had payid for the ticket and that it is the airlines problem to have enough space for their stuff. After 30 minutes discussing with the passengers they told them that either they calm down and give the luggage to be stowed in the belly of the aircraft or they would call security and they would stay on ground.

If not, you will know immediately why there were so many negative reviews for this airline. Their service in handling special situations are horrible. My first flight was hugely delayed for more than 4 hours and there was no compensation or anything offered by Air China for all the loss of time. Instead, they asked everyone to simply wait in front of the gate and take care of yourselves. Because of the previous delay, the connection flight could not be caught up and I was asked to change my connection flight at the Air China counter after I arrive Beijing. There was a big crowd of people, who also needed to change their connection flight due to the delay, was stuck as well in front of the counter.

Unfortunately the flight was cancelled (mechanical) after several hours of delay. It was chaos! At one point only one agent was handling all the passengers.

"I flew from LOT Polish Airlines Munich to Krakow via Warsaw. The MUC-WAW leg was ok, although not great. What happened on the WAW-KRK leg was outrageous. We boarded the Q400 on time. Takeoff was commenced and then suddenly aborted at high speed. The pilot announced that there were problems with the hydraulic controls of the plane. We were then bussed to another Q400 waiting on the apron, including the crew. Boarded again, started the takeoff run again, and aborted again at high speed for technical reasons. Even the cabin crew looked scared. We were then dumped at the terminal, with the flight cancelled for the day due to a lack of equipment (no wonder with two Q400 sitting inoperable on the tarmac). Finally, we were asked to go to the transfer terminal, where we were booked on a later flight, which had been upgraded to a ageing Boeing 737 to accomodate all the waiting passengers. This flight was an hour late, but at least it finally got us to Krakow. Besides all this, the airline feels decidedly second rate. Cabin service is uninspired, no free beverages except for lukewarm water. Not the kind of service you come to expect from a Star Alliance Carrier.

I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare.

The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems.

"  Terrible organization at Air Europa check-in for my flight from Barcelona to Madrid. I arrived at check-in two hours before the scheduled departure time, finding myself at the end of a very long, snaking queue full of families with large amounts of luggage. There were no Air Europa staff directing people to the self-check-in machines, which were invisible as they were hidden behind another queue of people. After standing one hour in that slow-moving queue I caught a glimpse of the machines which finally appeared. The machines are efficient and it took me less than five minutes to get my boarding pass (I didn't have any luggage). By the time I got through security and found the gate, boarding was already underway. It's quite likely I would have missed the flight or had to make a very stressful dash for the gate had I stayed in that queue - there was at least another half an hour or more before reaching the counter. The flight itself was fine. We were bussed to the plane, a spacious and clean 787 which shook and rattled for much of the journey. WiFi was available, as was entertainment on personal screens including maps. The seats are quite comfortable with reasonable legroom - certainly no complaints for a 1 hour flight. They made an attempt with a buy-on-board service but the flight is so short and the plane so large that they didn't reach where I was seated. A strong point is that cabin staff were numerous and visible, they double and even triple checked seat belts and other security regulations. Early arrival in Madrid.",Passive

"On the outbound journey LHR-DEL-BKK we wondered what the bad reviews were all about with good service and edible food albeit the standard curry or vegetarian on offer and a good selection of drinks available, however on the return flight the true horrors of this airline materialised. Breakfast, frozen melon and cold omelette with 2 frankfurters plus something in the corner of the dish which I have no idea what it was. Lunch, frozen curry, frozen salad and an ice cold bread roll, really appetising to say the least. The cabin crew warmed the meal up twice but it was still frozen. The plus side if there was one was the cost of the flight, saved us almost a Â£1000 on the 4 tickets in total so I think the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" sums up Air India.",Detractor
" London to Guangzhou. I flew with China Southern Airlines on CZ304 on my trip back from London. Thanks to their attentive staff and quite updated content of their on board entertainment system, this long journey turned out to be a relaxing experience.

We got off of our cruise ship at 9am on 7/20/18 and were required to take the shuttle to the airport where I waited with my mother, my 14 year old son and his 14 year old friend.

 Oslo to Minneapolis via Paris. My luggage got lost between Paris and Minneapolis on the 21st March. I received it on the 25th of May. I have a receipt and many emails saying I will be compensated USD 300 - I have still after three months not seen the money. I get emails from Delta all the time saying how sorry they are and that the amount will be put into my account but it never happens. All emails they send cannot be replied to. There is only one Norwegian phone number provided that transfers me to KLM Holland. They transfer me on to the USA where I am put on hold for long times. I hanged up once after 34 minutes. I have called and spoken to a number of people I have been transferred to but never end up with the right person. They all tell me to go to customer-care@delta.com. I have done that several times but only end up with emails saying how sorry the are and that the email cannot be replied to. I has been a nightmare and no one takes responsibility. But they are extremely good at saying how sorry they are and send email to me time after time that the money will be transferred to me!,Detractor
" Berlin to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Check in at TXL was smooth. We were bussed to a A330 for the first leg to IST. The IFE screens were not working for half of the seats in the main cabin. Also not during the safety instructions and I was shocked to see that the cabin crew did not ensure passengers were given a demonstration instead or checked if seat belts were fastened and specific rows were cleared of hand luggage. The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. IST-KUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present, is TK a hit or miss? The IFE is great (when it works) and they certainly serve excellent food! IST is a nightmare but that's another review.",Promoter
" Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid Â£56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn't help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return.

NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!,Promoter
" Copenhagen to San Francisco. My luggage was lost when arriving to SFO. That happens - but there were no ground personnel present when the waiting time at the belt was over. No one in the entire airport has any relation to anything SAS-driven so nobody could help me. Only option was to file a missing bag statement on the web. Since ground personel were not available until the next day 11 am (19 hours later!), I decided to call the danish support line. From which I got a most arrogant person who obviously had no time to help me. I have my bag tag so the system can track where my bag is - which matters a lot to me as I need to move away from San Francisco. One thing is that SAS can not provide any support in an airport like SFO (incredible!) - even worse is it that head quarters dont care - in fact they are not even able to pretend to care. Terrible experience - SAS lost the their customer focus and has become a budget airline. Except that it is not cheap.",Detractor
"Me and my family (spouse, myself and our 2 year old) recently flew to London, and Air Canada was a subpar experience, and child/family unfriendly. Toronto to London departing at 6:30pm, online check-in did not work and we had to join the regular queue. My wife and I were not seated together although we booked our seats online next to each other. Air Canada staff worked things out with another passenger so the three of us could be together. During the flight, they didn't turn the lights out for about 5 hours into the flight citing 'having a full flight and being busy'. The return flight departure was delayed by 1 hour. We were again seated separately and when I asked, their staff suggested we work things out with other fellow passengers. They did the same to another family with an infant and another couple. People were seated away from their travelling partners. They helped only when I continued to insist. Food on both flights was ok. We received the bags super quickly on both legs.",Detractor
 I had an international flight from Zurich to New York JFK then La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. I have been kept in security and custom border protection for security and here in LGA that was humiliating. At the last moment of boarding I almost missed my flight.

" Paris CDG to Warsaw. LOT POlish is consistently one of the worst airlines in Europe. LOT in Polish means flight, but it actually is an abbreviation for â€œLate or Tomorrow.â€ It's one thing to be consistently late, it's quite another to not care, and make no effort to make up lost time. If you are a member of United frequent flier program, they award half, or less, UA Miles than Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian or SAS. They are a budget airline in terms of services, but not price. I fly a lot, and live in Warsaw, and have begun flying on indirect flights on Austrian, Lufthansa or Swiss, even when a direct flight on Lot is available. I'll wait for a longer connection if possible to avoid using Lot. Regularly, mileage earned on their flights does not post to my United account - 75% of the time, I have to manually request credit two weeks after the flight. There are so many other options - Wizz Air, other airlines, even walking or riding your bike, is a more reliable and enjoyable option. Truly an airline of last resort. Today, as usual, they are late. Cabin staff are rude. No effort to expedite boarding. Plane arrived on time. Just pure inefficiency. Avoid at all costs.",Detractor
JFK-POS. Unfortunately Jetblue has lost its edge and is now very similar to the other U.S. carriers.

Tel Aviv to London via Helsinki. Flight from Tel Aviv departed at 1.20am and arrived in Helsinki at 6am but they kept the lights on for the entire 4.5 hour flight. Bizarre and absolutely ridiculous. There were only 8 or 9 blankets on board and I think I got the only pillow by asking about them during boarding. The food on this leg was nice and the staff okay. From Helsinki to London the staff were friendly and active but the food was very plain. A tiny bun with cheese. Economy passengers have to pay 3 euros for a newspaper which is daylight robbery.

About half way to the airport, we get another email now saying the flight had been moved up again and would be leaving in 1.5 hours.

My husband called Spirit and was on hold for 1 hour and 10 minutes only to be told that Spirit could not get us to Chicago until Friday and this was Monday evening! We were told to go to the airport and talk to them which we did at 10.00 am this morning only to find out that there are no Spirit employees even at the airport until 4.00 p.m. and there were not even any kiosk signs for Spirit. It was if they didn't even exist. We then had to pay over $1000 to fly home on Alaska because we have jobs and could not wait another 4 days to get home. I will never fly this airline again.

The seats are quite narrow, but I'd say for short distance flights it's ok. Also the staff seems to be pretty young.",Passive

"  San Francisco to Keflavik with WOW air, The experience was an absolute nightmare. Our flight was delayed by 27 hours. At first the customer support line didn't even ring - it just hung up on you. Later in the day, after alternate flights had left already, the customer service line allowed you to wait for an hour to talk to someone, who of course could do nothing to help you. Since they only have one aircraft to serve the route, our delayed flight the next day was outsourced to some sort of charter operation, so we were eventually loaded onto an unmarked A340 that had been in storage. This plane was completely gutted for storage (i.e. no paper towels) and was only loaded with one water bottle and a prepackaged food item (sandwich or pasta salad container) per person before the 7 hour flight. Needless to say the outdated entertainment system didn't work, but also the reading lights and even the attendant call buttons were inoperative. Upon arriving in Reykjavik, of course there was no gate for us so we were bussed to the terminal. No big deal - however then the entire plane load of people waited over 2 hours before the bags showed up. There was not a single person from Wow air at Reykjavik who had any idea what was going on - or cared for that matter. Their answer to any customer complaint is ""we're a discount airline, so we can't help you"". We did fly on an actual Wow plane on the return trip (delayed of course), and it was barebones, but comfortable. My wife and I were traveling to Iceland to celebrate my 50th birthday, and this is my lifetime worst interaction with a company where I paid money in exchange for a product or service.

LHR-BKK return. Outbound service was all smiles from the two ladies servicing our section. Food (beef) was served in the same foil type dish as an economy meal and the quality was about on par with economy - dreadful! A ready meal from a supermarket tastes far better and what does that cost? Makes you wonder who makes cost cutting decisions and whether they factor in the real costs of losing a customer. Return journey I had the lamb which was pretty much inedible. Crew on the way back were poor in our section with no smiles and just seemed to be going through the motions. The seat is angled lie flat which makes it impossible to sleep. Only mild positive really was the IFE with a fairly decent selection of movies and all in their original uncut versions. Basically you get more space but the food is no better than economy. Worth an extra Â£1300 over the economy ticket - you decide.,Detractor
Amman to Hong Kong with a 1hr stop in Bangkok. I was pleasantly surprised with the new A330. A decent entertainment system but with a round trip of 11-13hrs each you would have seen all the movies and left with re-runs on your return. The food was ok on the first trip but on the return the options were limited and the food was generally too spicy out of Bangkok and no way to avoid it. The crew was still typical RJ crew some were quite nice but generally would ignore you if you called them they attended to me 45 minutes after!

Although the vast majority of Ryanair staff we encountered on our flight from Bournemouth Airport were helpful and polite the first woman we encountered on check-in was utterly obnoxious. We had arrived 11 minutes before check- in was to close and no other passengers were queuing except ourselves yet the woman did not meet us with a professional greeting of good morning but barked at us 'You have one minute to process your baggage' and as my husband's suitcase was over the weight limit was unhelpful in resolving the situation and refused to allow us to pay a fine there but only when we had removed the offending items and struggled with them to the departure gate. My husband and I were stunned by this aggressive attitude and absolute lack of professionalism.

" Munich to Seattle via Cologne. On September 24, 2018, my flight back from Cologne was initially delayed approximately 10 hours, thenafter flying for 5 hours, we were told that due to the delay, the US borders were closed and would not allow us to land. We then had to fly for 5 more hours back to Cologne. No passengers were offered drinks, snacks, or a meal. That then totals to a 20.5 hour delay. After arriving back to Cologne, staff told us that the next flight out of Germany to Seattle would be from Frankfurt, which is a two hour train ride from Cologne. By the time I arrived in Frankfurt, the other flight had already taken off. I, and about 15 other passengers from the original flight, had spoken to the help desk of Lufthansa, the owner company of Eurowings, and they told us they cannot any help and told us to go back to the Cologne airport to speak to Eurowings. Out of the 15 passengers, only two spoke German, so it was very difficult to communicate and understand what was even happening/going on. I did not have international phone service and two of my children were in other countries, and another was back in America. My family did not know where I was because Eurowings refused to release any information about the original EW168 flight on September 24th. We then gathered as a group, after over 35 hours of no food or sleep, and had to make the best decision for ourselves to get back home to America. We then consulted with a different airline and only 11 seats were available, therefore, 4 people were left stranded in Frankfurt. Eurowings originally offered no financial support, although stated by EU Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to up to â‚¬600 in compensation when their flight lands at their destination more than three hours late. It was over 48 hours until I was able to land back in America and Eurowings has had my bank statements ever since, and have yet to offer any compensation. It has now been over three months since this situation, and I have not received any financial compensation for my time.

We were lucky that we got on with food and coffee from the airport lounge (as they take some time to serve - unlike Singapore) and the passenger next to us told us how grumpy he was due to hunger - after his 2 meals!

 Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good. They do really discriminate passengers from different regions. Providing different services to different passengers.I have traveled quite a lot but never gotsuch treatment.,Detractor
"  The new SAS business class really is a great product - and fantastic value for money, at least when booking it from outside the Nordic Countries. When I was looking for business class seats in March from Frankfurt or Milano to HKG, SAS was the best on offer in terms of value for money, a third to other Star Alliance carriers. The new seat is really great and comfortable - and the overall cabin rehaul works very well with a sense of peace and relaxation, particularly on SAS A330. SAS could improve a bit on food - and the airport experience in Arlanda (e. g. no lounge SAS lounge after passport control). Staff were friendly but also a bit reserved.

"Although we flew to Malaga with easyJet we returned with Ryanair as the flight time was more convenient and the cost was slightly less, especially as it was in euros, although I declined Ryanair's ""kind"" offer of their guaranteed exchange rate. (Even with the surcharge imposed for credit card use I paid less than via Ryanair's guaranteed rate). Apart from that possible catch in the booking process, everything else about our Ryanair experience was fine. Boarding was efficiently handled and even a difficulty with our boarding passes - the barcodes could not be read - caused no comment. The cabin crew did sterling work managing to stow everyone's cabin bags in overhead lockers, even telling passengers whose bags had to be located away from their seats where exactly their bags were to be found. There certainly seems to be a more customer-friendly approach from Ryanair these days and we are less apprehensive about being caught out in some minor, but expensive, infringement. Though it's still wise to read all the small print before flying, we are now quite ready to choose Ryanair if flight times and prices suit us. We still find their 'leather' seats less than comfortable after a couple of hours, however.",Passive

"  Tel Aviv to Paris CDG return. We arrived at Tel Aviv to see that the flight had been delayed 50 minutes. When the time comes to board the plane we get the news that takeoff has again been delayed because the plane had reached its weight limit. The flight attendants went around offering passengers trips to different destinations in order to get them off the plane to decrease the weight. After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel. In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable. We arrive at Milan only to hear more bad news, we were told that the plane had hit a bird, which meant that we had to change planes. To summarise the story, we arrived at Paris CDG after an 8 hour flight, exactly double the amount of time it should have taken. We had lost half of a day on our short trip, arriving at 5:30am local Paris time instead of 12:30am. We arrived tired, with very little time to sleep.",Detractor

" Oklahoma City to Melbourne, Florida. The flight started with a delay on the tarmac, â€œmaintenance and paperworkâ€ 20-30 min. On our approach to Charlotte for my layover I realized we were circling the area? The pilot eventually lets us know we're in a holding pattern because of weather issues and that if it persist we would have to fly to another airport to refuel. We did, we had to refuel in Tri City Tennessee. By this time I've missed my connecting flight to Melbourne! Once we landed in Charlotte I exited the plane to find the entire airport in complete chaos! I check in at the ticket desk to find out what flight I now need to catch to finally get to my destination, Melbourne Fl. At this point the ticket agent let me know, there were no more flights to Melbourne! â€œGo to customer serviceâ€ I did, once there the customer service agent was rude, incompetent to the point another agent had to help navigate the computer system! End result, I had a choice, stay the night in Charlotte at a hotel on my dime, â€œbecause it isn't American Airlines fault, there was weather issuesâ€ so no they will not put you up in a hotel and catch the flight in the morning to Melbourne OR catch a flight to Orlando International. I did, I'm now out an additional $150 for a hotel and I've had to have my wife come and pick me up in Orlando and drive me back to Melbourne to pick up my vehicle.

I booked a last minute trip from Orlando FL to Hong Kong. The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again. Its not only bad service they provide but bad attitudes and they want to change you for every single little amenity. Avoid this airline if you can.,Detractor
 Zanzibar to Doha. Late afternoon departure from Zanzibar. The aircraft was an Airbus 320 with old-style Business class seats. I had a window seat in row 2 of 3. The flight was just over 6 hours long and I felt terribly uncomfortable for the whole duration of the flight. When the seats in front of me were fully reclined it gave a claustrophobic feeling and it was very difficult to get up from the seat. It would have been okay for 2 hours but not for 6. The service was a little confused with two FA's for a full Biz class cabin (12 pax). iPads delivered for entertainment but very limited selection.,Detractor
Heathrow to Beijing Beijing to Singapore and then back via same route. All planes were on time and embarkation was efficient. The Singapore legs used clean new planes with excellent entertainment systems. The longer London legs were both on a very old plane. It was clean but decidedly tatty. The food on all legs was unappetising and fell well short of any other airline food that I have ever had. Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane. The cabin staff were very task orientated and not people focused. I didn't find them friendly and they were uncomfortably cold.,Detractor

My medication makes me very nauseous sometimes and unfortunately I vomited right before taking off. The crew was concerned for the safety and health of the other passengers so we went back to the gate. Needless to say I was very embarrassed. I was asked to get off the plane and had concerns due to the fact that I had an 8 year old at home that had no care the following day. The pilot came out and introduced himself. When I told him the story and he saw that I was doing fine he became an amazing advocate for me. Although the plane was now delayed 2 hours, because of him, I was able to get back on and he even made sure I made my connecting flight. I appreciate his kindness and compassion.

I flew from Brisbane to Heathrow just before Christmas. I was not looking forward to this flight at all but it was the only one in my price range. In all honesty I can say I will never fly with them again. The 2 main reasons for this being 1) the food was horrendous and 2) the inflight entertainment was the worst on any airline I've flown it was difficult to use and the selection of movies was very small. The experience didn't get any better at the 7 hour stopover in Guangzhou. It has to be the most boring airport I've been to. You can't even connect to the wifi in there. Just fails all round.

However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his.

PRG-RIX-KBP. Probably one of our worst experiences. When we got to the Prague airport we were told that we had to pay 150 euros for 3 checked bags (none were overweight) and our boarding passes which apparently we were supposed to print out before if we didn't want to be charged (which we didn't know about).

Main meal on return not tasty and a weird choice - oddly spiced chicken with curried rice. Served with 20% real juice drink. Also on return, food served often but items borderline bizarre - deer sandwiches, strange pocket thing. Felt like SAS shopped for the cheapest stuff they could find. Transatlantic, almost all was free, but you had to pay for sodas! Also at one point, peddled large sandwiches at a price. Flight from Nice to Copenhagen, not even water was free - though coffee and tea were! - and absolutely no inflight entertainment.

"I have just taken a very long haul flight half way across the world with Etihad in economy, and I am shocked at the service I received. Etihad seriously lacks in a lot of areas. I expected so much more from such a high profile airline. Check-in was the best part as a member of staff noticed I am very tall and sourced an exit row seat for me which I was extremely thankful for as it was a 13hr flight, but the tired Boeing 777 had uncomfortable aged seats and I couldn't wait to land. I selected a non-lactose meal, and it seemed to be half the amount of the regular meal, why is this? I had no bread roll or desert (both didn't contain dairy). On a 13hr flight we were only given two small meals and a snack which was a muffin. I didn't see any attendants for hours in between meals. I only noticed one lot of drinks being bought round, and other customers had to constantly call for drinks and food, and when asked it seemed such a big effort for them. The attendant who served me hardly spoke English, and didn't have a clue what was going on. I asked for a coffee and the cup wasn't even half full. I asked her why, and she said she ran out of coffee! Abu Dhabi airport shops were all high end expensive boutiques, not much opportunities for normal people. Most travelers were swarming the food court and alcohol and tobacco shops, no one was in the expensive ones. Toilets were disgusting! I asked at a transfer desk if there was any way I could get an exit row seat, I was just told ""no, the flight is full"". Unexceptable in my opinion. It is so uncomfortable and stressful having to sit in a regular seat when you are very tall, it makes the journey a nightmare. The A380 was a nicer plane, but everything else was still terrible - like the first leg. Attendants were rude and unhelpful, they had no sympathy for me being squashed in a normal seat. This was only a 7hr flight but we received more drinks than the 13hr flight? On both flights VOD was awful. I had flown with Etihad a few years ago and it was just the same, but I thought I would try again and see if they had improved due to the new fleet of aircraft, but how wrong I was.

" This review relates to a booking I made for December 2018. I would warn transit passengers who travel to a destination country other than China to book connections with China Southern that include flights CZ332 (Frankfurt - Guangzhou) or CZ331 (Guangzhou - Frankfurt). Both flights have a so-called ""technical stopover"" in Changsha, which lasts less than 90 minutes and during which the transit visa process has to be completed at the airport. In case of delays of the incoming flight or during the transit process, there is a high risk of missing the onward flight to Guangzhou (or the subsequent onward flight to the destination country), as due to having two landings in China, travellers receive only a 24-hour transit visa instead of the usual 72-hour transit visa, which then may no longer be sufficient to successfully continue the journey to the desired destination. Unfortunately, I had not informed myself enough before and made the mistake to book such a flight. I wanted to cancel my booking on the next day because of this problem but they charge the full cancellation fee of 300 Euros.",Detractor
Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again.,Passive

Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize.

The product was outdated with old recliner style seats arranged 2x2 with decent legroom and was clean and well-mantained considering the age. IFE from mainscreen was poor and a problem on a day-time flight. Two meals were offered - hot canapes inedible and out of place even in economy class. FAs attentive and professional. A few hours later lunch was served which was much better with generous portions and good quality. Arrival in Beijing was without any hassles. Beijing-Delhi check-in was a mess in spite of a dedicated business class counter - unfriendly and inept staff. The whole process took over twenty minutes. Old Boeing 767 with the same seats but PTV's - IFE choice was limited with 3 movies running on loops. Hardly inspiring considering AVOD being a norm now even on many regional carriers. The dinner was of a high standard. The real issues came when I landed in Delhi. In spite of a new terminal Ethiopian had no clear signage as to where the bags were being delivered. Subsequently upon finding the correct conveyer belt I discovered my priority tagged luggage had not been off-loaded with the conveyer belt showing bags delivered for the flight. The same was with another passenger on the flight. Ethopian Airlines staff could not be found and when we finally found one we came across one of the most unhelpful and petulent staff I have come across. The person was firstly dismissive stating bags would come in later until we had to show him the screen on the conveyer belt. Finally he picked up his cell phone and dialled someone asking for two black bags. No attempt was made to check on the baggage ticket numbers. Finally we waited another ten minutes until he stated that it was time for him to go home and the bags would be delivered. We had to involve the customer service desk at Delhi airport who were helpful and ensured that we were attended to. Planes old punctuality good and inflight service excellent but the outdated product poor ground handling at Beijing and Delhi are major negatives.,Passive
"  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointed to see the decline in quality from BA since I last flew with them. For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort. Good points: the cabin crew were reasonably good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection, but that wasn't enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience.",Detractor
"  Flew Kathmandu to Dubai. Flydubai proves the theory that you absolutely get what you pay for. What seems like a deal is simply payment for a less than optimal customer experience complete with lost baggage and absolute disregard for traveler's most critical needs. Case in point: A recent 3 day visit to Dubai was all but ruined given the fact that I was forced to spend the entire 3 days of my visit enlisting my hotel's staff and calling directly to this airline in an attempt to claim my lost luggage checked from Kathmandu to Dubai in the past week. Despite promises from the airline for calls back and assurances that the baggage would be on a later flight on the day of my arrival, it was only on day 3 of my trip that a final call from the hotel to the airline revealed that the luggage had been found. However, to add insult to injury, the hotel was informed that I would be required to return to the airport to pick up my luggage rather than the airline rectifying their mistake by delivering the baggage to my hotel as any other reputable carrier would. In the end, I was forced to pay for the airline's mistake as I was required to pay airport taxi fees (higher than other taxis) to collect my lost luggage in time for my departing flight on the following early morning. Upon picking up my baggage, I was treated yet again, poorly being made to wait for at least an hour before being able to claim my bag, and also being met by rude staff who clearly couldn't have cared less that they'd so badly bungled the handling of my and many other passenger's belonging. This airline is unbelievably inept. A truly disappointing experience.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Dubai. Our flight took off and about about 2 or 3 hours into the flight the captain of our flight announced that our flight had been turned back to Johannesburg due to a problem at Dubai airport. No further announcements were made. On arrival back in Johannesburg we disembarked the plane and waited approximately 2 hours to receive our luggage, after which we were ushered to a bus taking us to a hotel where we would spend the night. Bearing in mind that our hotel arrangements were in place when landed back in Johannesburg, this could have been communicated to passengers over the PA system or by Emirates ground crew. We were not given any update as to what would happen to our connections. We were shuttled back to the airport at 2am, boarding commenced at 3am and we took off again at 5 am. At no point were we given any indication of what would happen to our connections. When we arrived in Dubai (around 3:30pm) we were greeted with the chaos that was Dubai Airport, and then spent 11 hours waiting to be assigned new connecting flights. I was eventually given a connecting flight to Hong Kong 2 days later and put on standby for a flight leaving 3am on 5 August. Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications. Passengers on flights that arrived an hour or 2 after hours sailed through to their connecting flights as is customary because they had been issued with connecting boarding passes at their departing airports. They also lost my luggage for the duration of my trip!",Detractor
" I had taken the morning flight to Delhi as part of my onward connection to San Francisco and as the web check-in was already done prior to arriving at the airport, the baggage just had to be dropped at the counter. Then post security checks boarding happened on time which was a plus but as the checked in baggage was still getting loaded it caused a slight delay in pushback and departure happened 20 mins past the scheduled time. Once airborne, refreshments were served consisting of pav Bhaji with samosa chaat and chocolate cake which was very sumptuous. Arrival into Delhi was 15 mins past the departure time but it didn't cause any problems with catching the onward flight. It was a good standard flight and everything went well.

" Washington to Newark. First and last time on United. I purchased a basic economy ticket. If only I had known. When I went to check in for my return flight tomorrow, I was given an option of getting a voucher if I took a later flight. I would have taken a later flight, as something has come up where I'm visiting, but it would have to have been a bit later than the three flight options presented. I then made the mistake of calling customer service to see if they would help. It only made me more aggravated. You see, even though they have extra seats on the flight I would have gladly taken to free up my seat on their overbooked flight, I was told not only would I not be able to do that, I would be charged a bunch more money - I'd mention the amount here, but I could not hear the supervisor and she seemed annoyed when I asked her to repeat what she said. (I was calling from a good landline, not sure what they use over at UA). I don't envy those customer service reps. I would not want to be representing UA. I have since Googled about them and their customer service and business practices seem to be lacking, to put it mildly.",Detractor
Glasgow to Berlin return flight 23rd to 30th January. Both flights on time aircraft clean seats were fine for what is a short journey. Took longer than usual to board on the outward flight mostly due to the scrum to find overhead locker room for the hand-luggage as people understandably want to save Â£27 for the privilege of checking-in a case. Only gripe is that Easyjet are not as flexible with hand-luggage as they used to be it's a strict one bag per person rule meaning handbags sandwich bags etc must go in your hand-luggage. In Berlin they were checking the size of the bags in the metal cages so be sure that your bag isn't bulging!,Passive

"  Epic flights and unacceptable lack of information. Montreal to Nassau via Toronto after being advised by e-mail of a possible delay in flights to Toronto, I was able to anticipate and change my Montreal-Toronto flight for another departing 5 hours earlier. It caused me long hours of waiting in Toronto but at least I could have my transfer to Nassau. Return no email notification of possible delays. Yet the Air Canada AC 1817 flight from Nassau to Toronto takes off 40 minutes late. Arriving 40 minutes late in Toronto, passengers in transit to Montreal were advised that the Toronto-Montreal AC 7564 flight will wait for them, but they must rush to retrieve their bags and return to customs. The suitcases took a little time to arrive but finally, after having recovered them, we were advised that the plane actually had left, without us! It was the last flight for Montreal, the next flight leaving the next morning. Given the late hour (1am when I was rebooked), it was of course impossible to get a room at any hotel to return a few hours later at the airport. So we had to spend the night at the airport and leave the next morning, which caused me a lot of inconveniences. If a delay could be acceptable, it would have been appropriate to notify passengers by e-mail as they did in the first place, in order to allow us to make arrangements. Moreover, it is unacceptable to tell us that the flight will wait for us to tell us 10mn later, after we crossed the airport running with our suitcases, that it actually left without us! This is not the first time that I have been directly affected by Air Canada's deplorable service and I would like to point out my discontent with traveling with you.",Detractor
JNB-CDG 4th February. Short haul is pleasant enough and efficient (though avoid Paris Charles de Gaulle if at all possible Orly is a delight). Long haul (A380 economy) was a short haul experience on a long haul flight. I found the seats were thinly padded and barely reclined food short-haul standard. Where the French no doubt find the cabin crew efficient and focused as a Brit I found them professional but stand-offish and unwelcoming.

The man on the customer service line led us to believe we would receive a flight voucher of some kind a small we waited more than 3 hours. After waiting about 4.5 hours, a $15 meal voucher was given. Since we had already been waiting for a long time, obviously we had already eaten, and the voucher was meaningless to us. After calling the service line a second time, we were told there was nothing they can do. Maybe they save us some money on flights, but my time is worth more than a $15 meal voucher.",Detractor

Was worried about the connection as I was flying Air India, but was the cheapest ticket flying out of Chennai at that time and never flew on the Boeing 787 so decided to take the risk. Got to the airport three hours early but no one was servicing the Air India counter which really got me worried that the flight was delayed and I would miss my connecting flight. The check in counter finally opened 2 hours before the flight and was really slow, however they did manage to check everyone through and the flight did depart on time surprisingly. Flight was comfortable and impressed how clean the aircraft was and the crew were friendly and professional. IFE was average but easy to navigate.

ORD-YYZ-LGA-ORD Jan 3-6. Flight out to Toronto was fine. Delayed a bit in Chicago but landed on-time. Flight attendants friendly and love AA's new E-175 jets.

Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.,Promoter
JFK to Madrid. Plane was a clean A340-300. I got the window seat and no one sat next to me so I had extra space. The air conditioner was broken so when we got on it was about 90 degrees.

Flight Attendants spoke perfect English and were nice and helpful. I slept for 3 hours woke up just in time for breakfast. We were late because of the whole air conditioner incident and almost missed our connection to Rome. The plane was an A321. Flight was uneventful and was not particularly good or bad.

"This is not reflective of BA in general only this particular flight. I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. Anyway I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising.",Passive

"This is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with BA longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money.

As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March.

I flew to Zaragoza for a short business trip two days ago and everything went very smoothly: on-time departures, clean aircraft, friendly and polite crew. The price was EUR 120 return but I booked just 9 days before so it is still a good price considering this destination is very difficult to be reached via Madrid or Barcelona and a direct flight from my hometown is a huge plus.

We flew Air Canada which was delayed by 2 hours. Once we landed we went to baggage claim only to find out that our luggage isn't there. Once we start asking around we find out that Alaska Airlines never handed our bags over and so we have no idea where our bags are. I call the Alaska Airlines to figure this out only to be put on hold for 25 minutes and be scolded and talked down to because â€œI should be greatful that they even accommodated me and switched my flights.â€ When they were the ones that cancelled it in the first place. Then I ask where exactly is my bag and get the run around again only to be told it could be in Portland or in Vancouver somewhere or it might even be in Edmonton now. I then asked ok if it is in Edmonton now as you said it could be what's stopping someone from taking my bag before I get there tomorrow?! And she said â€œWell we don't know if it's there so you need to file a baggage claim. And you know what they accommodated you and so you should be happy about that.â€ Needless to say they were not helpful at all. Split up our party and gave me the run around. Not impressed at all. I would not recommend this airline at all.,Detractor

"  San Francisco to Reykjavik. I don't understand why people get upset with WOW air, it's a budget airline what do you expect? I had a good experience overall. When my brother and I checked in we had window seats and we were changed last minute to the middle aisle because the seats were supposedly broken but turns out their was a couple sitting there in our original seats, ramp agent could of been more honest with us. She did remdeemed herself by giving us both seats between my brother and I to ourselves giving us more space and she also put is in the front section of the plane with more leg room I was able to lay across 3 seats and take a nap. Overall, the inflight service was great the flight attendants are dedicated to their job. It's been a while since I enjoyed a flight, and never came across a flight were all crew members are polite and happy to assist passengers. WOW does charge for everything but if you take the time to go online everything is disclosed. They allow food purchased from the airport onboard. if you opt for their inflight food, they are vegetarian friendly and label nutrition facts on their meals which surprisingly are better quality than other Airlines I've flown. I will be returning to Iceland in the near future and I will fly with WOW again, the planes captain made this flight very smooth, hardly any turbulence during the flight both directions. On the way to Iceland he even made an announcement that the Northern lights were visible. Great experience.",Promoter

" Rome to Mumbai via Frankfurt. The flight from Rome to Frankfurt was late by 20-25 mins. The ground staff did not ensure that the passengers having connecting flight with very little transfer time left reached on time and could skip the line. There was a long queue at immigration. The ground staff didn't help the passengers to move ahead in line. At least 50-60 passengers were running from terminal A at Frankfurt to terminal C to catch the connecting flight. The staff at security would also not ensure that the passengers with flight could move ahead in line. There was a lot of chaos and people who could run were running, but people with disabilities or problems had to go through a lot of stress to reach to the aircraft. Lufthansa needs to work on this where the problem is at their end because their connecting flight was late. The only good thing that happened was that they delayed the takeoff of the connecting flight. But all the passengers had to go through a lot of mental and physical stress because of this mis management",Passive

She was coughing while working through our passports, she kept coughing and I asked if she's ok? She said she had just been outside (-15c).

I flew Brussels Airlines on a code share trip with United (where I am a mileage plus platinum) and was very disappointed. Brussels Airlines employees don't care about customer service. They did not assign me a seat until I was at the airport and by then only a middle seat was available on a 6 hour trip to Yaound Cameroon. There is no customer service phone number that works so you can't even complain. Their service is below standard.

"  Singapore to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. At the airport, the queue was long and the wait was long. The flight was delayed for about an hour but we managed to make it on time to Addis Ababa Bole. The plane was clean and service was good. The food was delicious and they gave amenities such as eye mask, toothbrush/paste and socks. The journey was comfortable and pleasant. However, at Nairobi my luggage was not there so we had to file a missing luggage report which took an hour. The counter staff informed that there are 3 remaining flights from Ethiopia to Nairobi and For the next few days, I have been checking online on whether the luggage was located but the status was 'Tracing continues' which was bad news. I only received my luggage 4 days later which was quite disruptive to my plans. Although this was an unfortunate event, I was overall quite pleased with the way the staff handled the situation. On my return flight, the flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was delayed for 2 hours. This caused many passengers who had connecting flights in Ethiopia to miss their flights. Passengers were told to go to various counters with no one at the counters. I was lucky enough to catch my flight. However, the information on the board directed me to go to Gate 13. At Gate 13, we were then informed that it was at Gate 4 and many of us had to run to the other end of the airport. One lady politely told the ground staff that there could be quite a number of people still queueing at Gate 13 and something needs to be done so that these people wouldn't miss their flights but she was brushed off with a nonchalant attitude. Overall, the plane ride was smooth. However, there needs to be a huge improvement in ground staff service.",Detractor

We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them.

" Qatar is still a great airline overall, but declining in some areas. Onboard service is fantastic, flight attendants are the best in the business, hard-working and hospitable in every way. The food is good. The seats on the A350 are nice, the B777 less so. The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through.

Return leg from BKK-AGP. As with the outbound all flights ran slightly early. Staff again professional and efficient and some friendlier than the normal Swiss staff. The Cabin Manger was very attentive and spoke to all passengers individually over dinner (interestingly he was in fact Spanish). Dinner as on the outbound was very good and as a late night departure quickly served which was appreciated. Fully flat beds again which is normal for the A340 and woken the usual 90 minutes prior to landing for a (very poor) breakfast which let this flight down. Could not find the arrivals lounge at Zurich but not important as has a shower at the departure lounge while waiting for the second flight.

" Dublin to Baltimore via Keflavik. A horrible experience from start to finish. Booked 2 flights but did them seperately and for some reason 1 had no luggage. I immediately called to adjust this but was told I hadn't ticked the section and instead of paying $10 more for the flight which would have included luggage I had to go online and pay $200 to add luggage. It took 2 phone calls and an hour on hold each time (I'm not exaggerating), and in the end I just paid it it online. Oh well, I marked it as my mistake. Then the nightmare began. Turned up at the airport and the luggage was still showing as unpaid on one flight. I was certain we had paid it online, we received confirmation and the ticket was upgraded to show luggage added, which we had printed out. They said there was an error on the site and the payment was not taken. So despite putting in the payment details, having it shown as payment confirmed on the site, receiving an updated ticket and printing this out and presenting this to the staff, the airline staff now said it was my fault for not checking the payment had gone through via my bank and we had to pay again. As a result we now had to pay $140 for the baggage (one way), which we had no choice but to pay. They wouldn't even allow us to pay the $100 for one way which we thought we had already paid (I'm putting it in dollars but actual payments were a mix of $, Â£ and Euro). On the stop over in Iceland we complained to the help desk and they said they understood and that it wasn't out fault. We were told that a note was added to the system and we wouldn't have to pay on the way back and if we emailed customer support (no way were were going to call them again), they'd refund the money. We were very anxious about it and emailed customer support during our trip, and it got worse. They said there would be no refund and we would have to pay for luggage again. We explained, they asked to be emailed proof. We sent photo copies of the payment confirmation and ticket showing luggage, and they didn't reply. We tried again a second time and exactly the same, they said it was our fault and asked for proof, we sent it, they didn't reply. As a result we paid for the luggage again on the way back. To rub salt into the wound we had paid for exit row seats and during the online check in one of us was switch to a standard seat in the middle. We tried to change this online and it asked us to pay $60. At this stage we were too tired to try to fight it. We didn't pay and sat seperately and just got the horrible experience over with. We since complained to their customer service and suprise suprise there was no response. Anyone thinking of using this airline please do your research and read up on the many complaints you'll find about them online, especially with regards to customer service. It's possible that if there are no small errors or mishaps you would not have to deal with their customer service and then write a review about their Ok leg room and slightly bigger than average inflight screens, because you haven't experienced the customer service or been caught out by their small print tactics. But any slight issue or changes and you are in for a nightmare - it's really not worth the risk. Avoid this company at all costs. I just wish we'd been warned and read the reviews.",Detractor

But when you have to transfer and the airline know they will not transfer your luggage but fail to mention is another story.

"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive.

I really wanted to like Alitalia as my husband and I had an amazing time in Italy and had great experiences with all the people we met there. However the service on our flight was horrendous. Firstly our plane had to be about 20 years old. There were large tube TVs that came down from the ceiling including one who's picture was always green and another who's rolling screen made it impossible to watch. This I can forgive as I know not to expect TVs on every seat on every international flight. What I can't forgive is the deplorable service onboard. No smiling no eye contact no please no thank you no your welcome. Nothing. They served a meal and one round of drinks. They only served half the plane coffee/tea then for some reason stopped. They stated drinks and snacks would be available for the duration of the flight. After the meal service we saw no one for a very long time we pressed the call button for a drink and no one came. Finally we saw a flight attendant walking by and she said we had to go to the back of the plane for drinks. So we walked to the back of the plane where it was passenger self service. Passengers poured their own drinks while the flight attendants sat two feet away putting on makeup and chatting. I asked for a snack one pointed to the top shelf. No trash was retrieved between dinner service and maybe 30 minutes before landing. The only positive is that we landed where we intended which I know is the most important part but when you are paying thousands of dollars on tickets you expect more. We will never fly this airline again and will share our experience to deter anyone we know from choosing it as well.,Detractor

"I'll start by saying that the price is fair, we paid around 400 euros each for a flight from Tel Aviv to London which is quite a distance. The cabin crew were polite and decent but they still have to start acknowledging their own rules. They have a rule for carryon luggage 56x45x26cm, why can't they stick to that? Everyone got on the flight with massive bags that were obviously not fit to be carried on and then had to remove the luggage from the plane. Another thing that is annoying is the non-existant entertainment system. We had a family infront of us that had ipads and laptops with them. All you have is a magazine with pictures of things you can buy, and not to mention that everything on board from foods to drinks will cost you money. There are however, meal deals where you pay 6 euros and you get a bacon sandwich, a drink, and a bag of chips.

" Amsterdam to Hanoi via Guangzhou. Overall, we had a wonderful flight. China Southern Airlines offers very good service: excellent food, great seat and polite crew. The only downside of the flight was the boarding: their boarding process is really chaotic. They take your coat, offer you a welcome drink, want to take your meal orders, all at the same time. During the flight their service is on par with top airlines such as Qatar or Singapore Airlines: no trays and no trolleys in cabin, very efficient and elegant service.",Promoter
LHR-AMS-LHR in Club Europe on A321. Nice service for a short hop. I think BA's Club Europe product is better than their long haul product. No flat beds but aircraft were in good condition cabin crews professional efficient and genuinely nice. Food was actually edible with a cheese and charcuterie plate. Both flights delayed due to Heathrow congestion and Amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience.,Passive
London to Doha Boeing 787. Qatar Airways sets the standard for luxury business class with this airplane and it was the best experience I've had in many years. First class lounge at Heathrow Terminal was fantastic fabulous good great wines and nice staff. Onboard the airplane brilliant business class cabin and nice color scheme. I had a single window seats and truly private - better than most airlines first class. Meals served individually table style and food was good with a great selection of wines. Staff very efficient they don't smile much though but are courteous. The in flight entertainment had massive choice of movies and tv programs. Downside was arrival into Doha with long bus ride but the new airport is flagged to open this week and that will top this off as the best business class out there.,Promoter
" Horrible unprofessional company. I drove 2.5 hours to catch my flight from Las Vegas to Pittsburgh, only to get there and wait 4 hours for a delay. Once the delay was up they cancelled the flight at 1am in the morning because one of their crew members didn't show up to work!

" I've never had a seriously bad experience with a flight. However easyJet really must do something about the quality of their ground handling. I don't know who handles them in Vienna but we arrived to drop our bags and found the easyJet Plus counter unmanned. Thinking we were slightly early we waited. After a few minutes we were approached by a man who peremptorily ordered us to join the main queue. I refused point blank and told him as easyJet Plus customers we expected to get what we'd paid for, i.e. priority service. With no good grace he got behind the counter himself and did what he had to do so abruptly that I was surprised when our bags arrived in Edinburgh. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. At Edinburgh we landed ten minutes early and Menzies Aviation ran true to form. Firstly we came to a grinding stop on the apron because, as a clearly exasperated Captain told us, nobody had turned on the ground guidance system required for the aircraft to park on the stand. Having finally got on stand we then sat unable to deplane for almost a quarter of an hour because there were no steps. Three women with day-glo jackets and clipboards stood outside chatting, occasionally looking at the aircraft and clearly doing nothing useful. Once we eventually got off I asked a day-glo lady if the aircraft's arrival had come as a surprise to them. ""Well we were waiting for the steps"" was the response. Gosh, you don't say. I know from this and several similar experiences that you obviously don't have enough kit or enough people to handle the aircraft you're paid to handle. Not good enough. Come on easyJet, your product is good but the incompetence of your ground handlers annoys your customers and delays your flights. This needs to be sorted out before you start losing loyal passengers.",Passive
"Chicago to Manhattan Regional. My experience with American Airlines was tumultuous and stressful. After a long 4 hour delay, the airline decided to give up on any further attempts of getting us to our desired destinations. The error that occurred was not because of the weather, but ill-preparation from the flight crew. We were not accommodated in any way after the delay and cancellation, causing a loss of money. Our purchase or game tickets, hotel stays, rental cars, and even keeping our dog in a kennel at home became a huge waste of money, and all we got from the company was a simple, ""sorry.""

"I have been flying with KLM to Europe regularly over the past 3 years. I am very impressed by the efficiency, cabin service and attention to detail. On my most recent flight from Singapore to Oslo, via Amsterdam, it departed 2.5 hours late from Changi Airport. I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Oslo. Anxious to know whether I would be automatically rebooked, I paid EUR 20 to use the onboard wifi on the SIN-AMS flight. The connection was fast enough and I was relieved to receive an e-mail and text message from KLM that I would be re-booked on the afternoon flight to Oslo. Well done KLM for having a good team to do crisis management in situations like this. The economy comfort seat that I had was in the centre row just behind business class. No passenger was seated in front of me and I had generous leg space and could stretch out completely to sleep.",Promoter
SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.,Promoter

"  Los Angeles to Cusco via Lima. Horrible baggage service and terrible follow-up customer service. We booked through United Airlines and flew on United from San Francisco to Los Angeles, then changed airlines to Avian to fly to Lima, then change planes again to fly to Cusco. Our luggage didn't arrive with our flight so we asked why. Avianca baggage service told us United didn't transfer the bags to them on time to make the flight. They told us they'd have the bags brought to our hotel in Cusco later that same day. I called United Airlines baggage service to see why they delayed our bags and they told me that they didn't delay them, they transferred the bags to Avianca within 10 minutes of our flight landing in L.A. and 90 minutes before our Avianca flight departed. Avianca didn't deliver our bags by early evening, so I called baggage service again, after a lengthy wait on hold I was told that our bags hadn't arrived from Los Angeles yet but they would have them delivered to us early the next morning. Next morning, still no luggage so I called again, another lengthy wait on hold, then told that our bags left Lima but they couldn't gat any confirmation that they had arrived in Cusco. Baggage service in Cusco had no idea. We got very stressed out because we were leaving the next day to hike the Inca Trail with no change of clothes or hiking gear, not knowing if our luggage would ever arrive or if we needed to go buy all new clothes and gear. Several phone calls later and more ""we don't knows"" from Avianca and our bags finally arrived late afternoon of the 2nd day. I had told baggage service I wanted to file a formal complaint.

"Glasgow to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row seats with plenty of room, although the catering was a bit bizarre, a drink and a packet of crisps. The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers. The old British Airways corporate slogan ""The Worlds Favourite Airline"" are long gone. For our next flight to South Africa or elsewhere, I think it will be back to KLM for us.",Detractor

London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,Detractor

We go to the ticket sales where a woman finds us a new flight from Istanbul to Frankfurt and a Lufhtansa flight from Frankfurt to LAX, the day after again. One more night in Istanbul. At the check-in counter I'm told they can't check us in for both flights, ""Because we are two different companies"". They say we have to get the luggage back in Frankfurt and check-in again with Lufthansa. Luggage is not in Frankfurt, I ask for information at the baggage claim and they explain to me when luggage is in transit it's kept in transit 'til the final destination. We move to the departures terminal and check-in again, but there's no seat number on the boarding pass. As we arrive at the gate we find out that the Turkish Airlines employee had jut put us on a waiting list. Boarding refused. We go back to the TK ticket sales and after two hours they manage to find us a new flight for the day after. We ask for our luggage, as we have been wearing the same clothes for 3 days and we find out the luggage is not in Frankfurt at all, as it's been never loaded on our flight from Ataturk. We make a claim (fortunately the German personnel is far more professional than the personnel in Ataturk). They say the luggage will be sent to LAX with the next flight from Ataturk. The day after we finally fly to LAX with a LH flight. Luggage is not there. Another claim, they say to come back the day after because TK made another mistake and sent the luggage to Frankfurt. We spend a night in Los Angeles and finally the luggage arrives in the evening. Turkish Airlines is poor in dealing with the customer.",Detractor
LAX to LHR - 25 Oct 2014. I agree with other reviewers that Business Class on the A380 is too crowded. I am a frequent business traveller to LAX and if I had the choice I would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. The seats and small storage drawer (if you are on the aisle) feel cheap. Service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner (1 instead of 2) and no attention to top up during the meal. My main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. The staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them). We flew First on the outbound to LAX which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile. Considering switching to Virgin.,Detractor
First time with Delta and very pleased with the result. Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either. Flight was on time.,Promoter
I travelled between FRA and JNB on the A380. Like most I was disappointed that this state-of-the-art aircraft was not equipped with the lie-flat bed even though the website indicated that these flights would have them. Regardless I was able to find some level of comfort (eventually) on the angled beds - one has to play around with it until you find that comfort spot! Service overall was good and efficient and the food was fine as far as airline food goes. Nothing fantastic but then again nothing too bad.,Passive
TLV-DXB-TLV via Amman and again the same good experience with RJ. All 4 flights exactly on time no issue with service on board although the movie selection is fairly limited. Food was good and legroom on A321 more than adequate. Amman airport is a breeze to transit through and RJ crown lounge comfortable although food selection is very very basic and internet can be unpredictable. The rate was so cheap in comparison with any other choice. RJ are a good dependable airline and my first choice for travel inside the Middle East. They beat Emirates and Etihad hands down on flights to the UAE. Highly recommend.,Promoter

"  Cleveland to Phoenix via Denver. Worst airline ever, delayed for 10 hours before cancelling because of mechanical issues! No updates from the staff for the last 3 of those hours until they cancelled it. They told us the only options was a flight on Tuesday mind you this was a Sunday. I was going to take them up on the hotel room but by the time they found hotels rooms it was 2 am. I bought a 600 dollar last minute with American so I slept at the airport. Thanks for the 25 dollar food voucher! And the 150 dollars in flight vouchers that have to be used before 90 days. I will never fly this airline.

"  Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Pleased with Gatwick on lunchtime departure. Just check for South Terminal at F Gate, Nice casual boarding [unlike the demeaning line up and wait at Hong Kong]. Cabin staff always welcoming and helpful. Every seat taken - seems a Cathay method. Typically a polite crowd to travel with, majority Chinese, a few Australians and British. I had a low calorie meal on order, so got served maybe 30 minutes ahead of others and by personal delivery. Out of Gatwick the main was delicious fish - very good even if no choice and no menu. Captain message as usual on this airline was English name and well spoken. I rate this airline for having British pilots - gives me confidence in basic skills and also the ability to communicate clearly in the event of difficulties. I told myself the A350 has been in service on this route for over a year, and is used intensively, flying into Gatwick after 11 hours from HK and ready to return at lunchtime. The Cathay themed seats in aqua green are starting to look tired, as also the furniture in the toilets [Try liifting the lid and some stain on the rim]. I require several breaks from sitting as I rarely get to sleep. So I found a small space near the aft toilet where I could pass 30 minutes doing easy knee and toe exercises without being hassled by the crew. [This used to be easier on the 747 with its extra space]. The allocation of toilets was just ok, I counted five located midway and aft. The nice thing about the A350 is that it is not carrying huge numbers, easier to manage. The meals are only average, lacking some extras such as hand towel and block of real cheese. Wine [red or white] comes in a plastic glass - gone is the mini bottle. On boarding, there is no welcome juice or hot towel. The seats feel spacious but are short on supportive cushioning. I actually bolster the seat with the blanket and pillow to support low spine and thighs. The choice of movies is good but falls short of the Qatar Airways range. I enjoy checking the route out over Lowestoft and north to Denmark and the baltic states before an amazing great circle route over Russia through to China. I enjoy the live video cams showing take off and landing. Fortunately daytime on transit in Hong Kong Airport [It is depressingly closed there on night time transits] found a western style breakfast cafe. But kept wishing it was Singapore with its fantastic restaurants. From there Cathay lost points by transferring us to a tired looking B777ER and lining us up like cheap people for 30 minutes before boarding. They could do this much better. Deperture 30 minutes late was not made up. On attempted touch down in Melbourne [shown on video] the pilot aborted landing at the last moment and took off for another attempt. He blamed cross winds for this but I suspect the speed and decline were out of sync. Arrived 4 minutes late turning 11.05 pm. Just one thing to remember, on arrival at Gatwick the Cathay gate is very remote and there are no airport toilets for that sudden need, for maybe 20 minutes hard walking. Impression, love the airline its helpful crew and the route but will have to compare Qatar on price and miss the comfort of Singapore Airport. Disappointed by the B777ER on the Melbourne leg.",Promoter
"  Belfast to Newark return with United Airlines - it was great to be able to fly to direct. The flight departed on time and the service, both on the ground and inflight was attentive, unobtrusive and professional. The food was fantastic, with plenty of options.

Flew YYZ-WAW WAW-KRK August 2013 and WAW-ORD on the way back. Stand by is always fun attempted to get on the WAW-YYZ flight but there was no available seats. All in all it was a good experience flying on the B787 Dreamliner. The aircraft was brand new clean and impressive. Didn't like the fact that we landed in Warsaw and were parked on a remote stand having to board buses that took us to the terminal however this is probably not LOT's fault contact stand was simply not available in Warsaw. I was a bit disappointed with the IFE System and the food. The IFE could be much better offering more movies. A promo video for LOT would be useful as well. Food was not as good as it used to be a few years back when I flew their 767s. You can simply tell that they are trying to save on service. Flying to KRK was positive brand new Q400 operated by Eurolot. Very comfortable and much better than the old ATR 72. Both flights the staff was friendly and professional. All in all the Dreamliner is a huge improvement from the old 767s however areas LOT could and should improve in are: IFE Food OTP (on time performance).,Passive
Incheon to Dallas. I got an old 747 rather than a new 777. The flight was great good entertainment friendly staff and good food. The only problem is the seats are tiny.

Perth to KL and 8 days later back to Perth. We were fortunate to obtain hot seats which proved to be excellent plenty of room. Coming home we changed our flight to travel with friends that left a day earlier. Changes were made efficiently but we were unable to get hot seats. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food. We found staff to be pleasant efficient and I would not hesitate to book Air Asia again. The only thing I would make sure next time that I had a laptop to watch movies. Excellent flight and landed 20 minutes early.,Promoter
"Melbourne to Hong Kong. Seat 31G is not very comfortable but a lot better than regular economy seats. The leg rest for front row seats are useless because they are too short and bite into your calve. Foot rests for other seats are better. Seat width is fine but would much prefer full premium economy cabin. Check in agent was lovely and professional. Given priority access through immigration at Melbourne Airport but not needed as lines are fairly short. Anyway got through Australian immigration in less than 10 minutes. Once airside, used the Cathay Pacific lounge at Melbourne Airport. Lounge is tiny will a lot of passengers with limited seating. Food is boring, usual dim sum and noodle, etc. Looking very tired and unappetizing. A few alcohol at self service counter. There is an Nepresso machine. Boarding was organized with priority boarding for premium class passengers and Marco Polo members. Departed on time. Pre-departure drinks were offered followed by hot towel. Once airborne, lunch service began. Ordered vegetarian meal and served first. Food was disgusting and did not eat much of it. Some sort of hummus as starter and a main course of overcooked vegetable and some carbohydrate - really really awful. Pre-landing snack was alright, some kind of hard bread with feta cheese or unidentified dairy product. Cabin crew was very nice and professional. Present through the flight to serve passengers. Landing into Hong Kong Airport was on time. Overall a decent flight. It would be nice to have second hot towel service either before serving pre-landing snack or after, and also a salad dressing for the dinner salad instead of just a wedge of lemon as dressing.",Promoter
"  London Heathrow to Lisbon. Plane late leaving Heathrow, but captain explained. No complaints about that. When plane arrived at a remote spot at Lisbon Airport, stairs were wheeled up to the plane. There was a considerable step from the plane to the stairs. I asked for assistance for my husband who has arthritis in both knees and a foot. A stewardess told us, me having climbed back on plane up steep step, jarring a sore hip in the process, to go to front of plane where my husband could get assistance. Then one of her colleagues told us that we could have no assistance as we had not requested it when we booked in. I told her that in the absence of any notification to the contrary, flying from the capital city of one country to the capital of another, we would assume an airbridge. To be fair, staff did then assist my husband down the stairs. We are dreading our flight out of Lisbon to Madrid in 36 hours time as we do not wish to go through such a process again.",Detractor

  A five day trip to Singapore starting out on QF 81. Being a QFF the whole Qantas experience these days is very satisfying. Check in is through the priority channels which makes life a whole lot smoother. I'm old school and still like to be checked in by hand and not have to go through the self check in bit. Up to the business lounge and this is where Qantas needs to do some work. It was a Sunday morning flight so the place was packed with the Asia departures which all leave in the morning. The F & B were fine but Qantas should look at extending the lounge. The flight itself was uneventful. it was a refurbished A330 so the ICE was the new touchscreen. New comfortable seating and the FA's were great. Asked for a Jack Daniels and Coke and was served a quadruple which nicely put me out for a few hours.,Promoter

Others might have had a worse experience with that. Personally, I think the staff were very unfriendly and harsh sometimes. They didn't seem to be right in the position of working and interacting with people. No smiles, hardly any friendly behavior, some of them even were annoyed by us asking for water on a 18 hour journey. Also on short flights they cut down any food and beverages which meant we didn't get any water or coffee or anything for free on a 4.5 hour flight from Madrid to Frankfurt. We could have bought some really expensive beverages though. Haven't experienced that with any other airline so far.",Passive

I flew Spirit Airlines on April 18 from PDX to ORD. I flew them before several times so I knew the rules of online checking and printing the boarding pass at home only bring a small backpack to avoid luggage fees and have them select the seats for you in order to avoid paying extra. The plane was new although the seat space is the smallest in the industry. There is no entertainment so bring your own. Food and water costs extra so bring your own. Carry-ons cost extra so don't bring any. Check in online at home and print your boarding pass and save the $10 it costs to do at the kiosk at the airport. Just bring a backpack like I did and you don't have to pay any luggage fees. We took off early and arrived into Chicago early. Since I have their credit card I was able to redeem 5000 miles and pay just $13.10 for the one way ticket to Chicago. I can't emphasize enough how you must know what the fees are when you fly this airline. All the complaints come from people who did not do their homework and then have to pay at the airport. Spirit Airlines got me to Chicago safely at a fantastic price and for that I can't complain.,Promoter
PVG-LAX and IAH-LHR. Both flights were very comfortable. Seat and food is good. The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds.

Although the window transparency can be chanced it cannot be completely darkened and this is an issue when you want to sleep.,Promoter

CGK-DPS on a 738 DPS-CGK on a 333. First flight's check-in was mediocre not perfect nor horrible. One of my passengers forced me to sit in the emergency aisle the design of the arm rests for the emergency aisle seats make leg comfort too tight. Food was excellent and crew are very attentive. IFE content was limited on board due to the flight being a regional trip but is updated nonetheless. Flight was quick and on time. Second flight was on board an uncommon aircraft which allowed me to see inside their mid-haul fleet. Check- in is slow but this could be a result of the ongoing renovation of DPS. I was able to not sit in the emergency aisle. Seat pitch on board the 333 is very good fits tall passengers. Seat layout of 2-4-2 does not make seating tight another big plus. Attentive FA excellent food but IFE is limited again. The seat did not provide a USB gate even though the IFE menu has the option to access media from the USB. Great flight though.

"  This was just a short commuter flight from Porto to Lisbon as part of the Ponte AÃ©rea service from TAP. It was a small ATR plane, with just 70 seats and so, I wasn't expecting much. Check-in was fast but they med a mess with my pet carrier box, they insisted I had to get a soft one but never was I told that when booking or reserving for the pet itself. In fact, I had been told I should bring a hard carrier for the first outbound trip done by Azores Airlines, in codeshare with TAP Portugal. The lady at the counter even told me this requirement was over an year old when just last December I had flown with TAP Portugal and carried my pet in the same hard carrier and no one said a word about it. Fortunately the check-in lady was nice and helpful and called her supervisor to sort things out and all was solved. The flight was late and boarding was a bit slow. The airplane looked and probably was brand new, with a smart, modern and chic interior, much to my taste. Everything was very clean and tidy. No entertainment system was present, but that was expected for a 50 minutes flight. The airplane was very quiet and the amount of space was surprisingly decent, just a bit short on foot space. Catering wise it was bad. A coffee and a little biscuit, that is right, one biscuit. Nothing more. It was a shame there was no Wi-Fi service. Crew were friendly and helpful and the route taken lead to same nice view of the country shore line. I have to say that these Ponte AÃ©rea TAP Portugal service have some advantages over low cost airliners on the same route, like more baggage allowance, a small (very small) snack and the availability to change for a previous or next flight if you please.

Onboard food was terrible, I wish I'd taken more snacks with me before boarding. Flight attendants seemed pleasant. Lavatory was dirty. Upon arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo, I was completing the International to domestic transfer process when an Aeroflot staff walked up to me, grabbed my boarding pass with baggage tags attached and ripped them up. I was told that because I was traveling with a musical instrument (violin), I could not board the next flight with anything else other than the violin (I also had a computer, camera and Ipad in a personal bag). They threatened to cancel my onward journey if I didn't pay 7500 rubles to check my empty personal bag. Why wasn't this rule enforced at check-in?

A few old video screens spread so far apart that most couldn't see - that's if you wanted to watch Spider Man 2. This was a 9.5 hour flight and we were served a tiny dried up pasta dish and a glass of house wine - not individual bottles like most have.

Flew from YYZ to SJO longest 5.5 hrs ever. I have flown to SJO 7 times and that was the worst flight.

"Having spent the last 7 weeks travelling around the world business class with various airlines we were very excited about our business first class flights firstly Honolulu to San Francisco and then Newark to Edinburgh on our journey home. The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent Â£6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings. Please United Airlines take note of all these negative reviews you are offering a low budget service at a Premium price.

  Flew Wizz Air from Skavsta to Budapest. One of the worst airlines I have had the displeasure of dealing with. The tickets may seem cheap at first but they will take more money from you once you get to the airport. No free bag (unless its literally small purse sized) and even paying for a bigger carry on is extremely expensive. They will also tack on fees for not having proper format of boarding pass and when you go to pay for it all they charge you another fee. I just had a regular size (even smaller than average carry on) and a pdf of the boarding pass on my phone (which apparently is not ok) and it doubled the cost of my flight. Will not use them unless there is no other option.,Detractor
ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,Passive
Pleasant trip for both outgoing (KUL-DOH-MAN) and incoming trip (LHR-DOH-KUL). For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers. They would do their best to fulfil the request and they eventually did most of the time. I will go for Qatar Airways again!,Promoter

"Flight from SIN to AUH was in a new B787-9. Seat was much better than on Etihad's A330 aircrafts although legroom is quite limited (I am 1.88m tall). IFE had a large screen and was very nice, choice of movies is good but not as good as on other airlines. The IFE is deactivated nearly an hour before landing - could not understand why so early. Food was decent, drinks ok. Flight from AUH to VIE was with Flyniki on an A320. No IFE, but seat comfort was actually better than on the B787-9. Food was average, lots of plastic on the tablet.

"  I booked ""premium"" economy after reviewing the amenities on the website and discussing them with a live agent. (Wait time on the telephone was over 1 hr both times I called!) The flights from JFK - Hong Kong - Siem Reap were fine and the amenities, provided. The flights from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong to JFK were awful. Cathay had a delay which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was promised an upgrade by the gate agent because of the long wait I would have to endure. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, I was denied the upgrade and moved from my window seat to a center seat in the row of 5 seats. After much arguing, they miraculously found a window seat for me. They offered to provide a car in NY to transport me home which, after waiting an hour, they reneged on. However, the most disturbing issue is the advertising of amenities in ""premium"" economy: calf rests at the seat, separate check in and boarding lines and a champagne welcome. None of the amenities were provided. Other than being wider, the seat was no different than flying regular economy. The lines to check in and board were ridiculous and service aboard was awful. Attempts at resolving these issues have been met with a stubborn refusal to acknowledge that they did not provide a ""premium"" experience. Airline has no concern for customer satisfaction. I would never fly them again and certainly, do not recommend spending so much more money for ""premium"" when they don't deliver the product as advertised.",Detractor

" Flight from Amsterdam to Mexico was OK, the seat was comfortable enough and sitting in 6J with an infant on the first row of economy class right behind I was lucky enough to have a quiet flight. Service was attentive and the food, while lacking in presentation, was edible. The trouble started upon arrival in Mexico City at 3am, where I was to connect to a flight on the same business class ticket, but operated by Avianca. I'd chosen this connection for its shorter layover time. The transfer desk in the arrivals hall at MEX was unmanned, so I proceeded on my own to the departure hall's Aeromexico check-in area where I was told to switch terminals to check-in with Avianca. Since the monorail was not operating at that hour I was supposed to take a taxi. Once at the Avianca check-in counter it became clear that I was booked in economy to Bogota. Nowhere during booking was this evident (I even retraced my booking steps on the same connection at a later date to verify any mention of travel in economy). It seemed that the AV was already overbooked (i.e. known to Aeromexico) at the time of booking. Aside from the economy experience on a business class ticket, the less than smooth connection at MEX, Aeromexico took 6 weeks to respond to my complaint. Their Twitter account ignored me completely and when I received an e-mail response, let's just say that, for the result, in the end I might as well not have complained at all. On the return flight, no connection issues, however the food both out of BOG and MEX was subpar and the service was distracted and messy especially on the long haul stretch. Comming into AMS I had to ask for coffee creamer twice (coffee was poured and no milk or creamer was at hand on the trolley) and I had to grasp it from the purser's fingers as she dangled it over me when she came back from the galley talking to someone else. I left the omelet untouched, because I couldn't identify its filling and it tasted of nothing. Aeromexico is a disgrace to the Skyteam group.",Detractor

Among a suspicious tendency for silly comedies with bad taste and low quality. When you finally arrive, the crew opens all the acces of the aircraft to exit the plane without giving to the upper paying class tickets passengers the privilege to get out in the first place, policy that makes the exit from every plane from these Aeomexico airplanes, a nightmare.

Considering late afternoon flights from Orlando tend to get delayed due to late afternoon storms, that was a nice change.

" Minneapolis to Papeete via Los Angeles, the flight to Tahiti with Air France. Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly.

Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated. On a side note, I would fly Delta again and also Air France where the service and food were exceptional, even back in steerage.",Passive

"  We flew United Airlines from Seattle, WA to Newark, NJ on July 1, and from there we were to have a connecting flight to Norfolk, VA. Originally our route was supposed to be Seattle - Chicago - Norfolk, but a day or two before our flight United changed the route to go through Newark instead. We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again.

Well it was cancelled again so I had to get in line for the 3rd time another hour finally told the lady to send me with another airline which she did - Aeromar. I went across the hall to check in, surprise the ticket wasn't confirmed so I had to get in line again for the third time. Another hour just to get my ticket transfer confirmed finally my flight was scheduled for 5:30. I arrived in San Luis PotosÃ­ two hours later of course I lost my brothers wedding and my car rental reservation. It took me approximately 38hrs from Houston to San Luis. It was supposed to be 3.5 hours trip. I would never use that airline again. I ended up buying a direct return flight with United to Houston for 380 dollars.

" Santo Domingo to Fort-Lauderdale. My last experience with this airline was disastrous. I was supposed to fly at 3:45 am and the airline did not stop delaying the flight until it was almost 7 o'clock in the morning when we finally flew, not caring about anything at all, and without giving a real information of what was happening. I personally chose that time to fly because I should be at my job early, and end up losing more than half of the day. And if that were not enough, when we were waiting for flight Nobody was concerned about accommodating their customers in the way that was possible, we spent more than 3 hours without eating, going cold and unable to sleep. But the worst of all is that nobody received an apology for that unforgettable night. I am going to make sure that everyone who travels constantly knows about this event so that they do not go through the same thing that I unfortunately had to go through.",Detractor
" Orlando to Denver. I arrived to my departure gate on time, once there the attendent announced the flight was overbooked and they needed volunteers to wait for a later flight and offered an $800 voucher good for one year for future travel. I was not in a rush to get there and so I volunteered to take the later flight. Everything went smooth for my trip. However when I went to use my voucher 5 months later, it did not exist. I called the airline and talked to a representative who then said the voucher I received was only good for 3 months. I was nice and polite to the representative so he was kind and talked to a manager trying to help and fix the problem. The manager said Oh the voucher was only good for 3 months thats it, we can't do anything for you. So if they ask you to give up your seat for a voucher, don't trust them.",Detractor
"CPH-SFO in SAS Plus. SAS Plus is not quite business but far better than Premium Economy on most airlines. For example I've flown Y+ on KLM which basically means a little more legroom but otherwise the same as Y. With SAS Plus however you get FastTrack security check Lounge Access (at least their CPH lounge is pretty good with showers decent food and alcohol selection and fairly quiet at least when I flew quick internet access). The flight itself is in a bit wider seats than Y (wide enough to not be a problem I sat next to a ""heavier"" gentleman and we had no issues with the shared armrest) and with more than enough legroom. The food and drink service is also much better than in normal Y class. Unlimited alcoholic drinks and snacks throughout the flight and fairly good inflight meals (both dinner and breakfast - I really enjoyed the breakfast) with steal cutlery ceramics and glass instead of plastic plastic and plastic. Together with the 200% FF miles earning this was all a good value compared to regular economy. Especially if you upgrade through OptionTown. The only negatives is the tiny and dimly lit IFE system - I would have been better off watching a movie on my phone or tablet. However movie selection was good and recent (with at least a handful of the current year's blockbusters already available). And as always with SAS the cabin crew was excellent.",Promoter
"  Phoenix to Denver. I have read a lot of bad reviews of this airline. What people have to remember is this is a budget airline. Spirit Airlines is very clear about their charges, so you know going in that any extras are going to cost. The fees are clearly stated. Spirit lists their prices as ""bare fare"" and you have the choice at time of booking to add extras you want. When I need to book a flight, I pack light so I am not charged a carry on fee, I check in online so I don't pay a check in fee and I make sure I am not going to have any changes to my tickets. The only extra I pay for is the extra roomy seat, which is very comfortable. I eat a good healthy meal before I board so I am not hungry. Preparation is the key to flying a budget airline.",Promoter
"  Ft Lauderdale to Amsterdam via Atlanta. I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for â€œmeet and assistâ€ help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare â€“ my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response. Apparently loyalty is oneâ€“way only.",Passive
JFK to Zurich - economy. Most uncomfortable seating ever. I am only 5 ft 4 and 130 lbs but was in pain and claustrophobic. Narrow seats on top of it so you are nearly sitting on your neighbor.

" The Walmart of airlines. Incredibly unremarkable. The International Premium Economy seats are rather nice. The staff seem to care, but it is the details that are desperately lacking, the food which borderlines on institutional, the staff that are nice, but lack passion and enthusiasm, and the paltry amenities that are likes of standard coach of its European rivals. The domestic leg of the journey was reminiscent of Aeroflot of the Soviet days: crammed seating, cabin staff that could not care and food for purchase that is very sub-standard.

I travelled to Florida in March and was quite surprised at the services offered by Rouge. I was shocked to think that we had a 3 hour flight with no inflight TV screen to be able to watch movies etc. I detest the assumption that everyone has a device to be able to watch a movie etc. and always considered it part of the entertainment provided on my flight. I had my 90 year old mother with me and she was very frustrated at not being able to watch anything while travelling. If the flights were dramatically cheaper I could understand not having all of the conveniences but we definitely did not pay a cheaper flight. We are giving Air Canada another chance in flying to Las Vegas in July but if we do not have a better experience will reconsider future flying with Air Canada. Based on the reviews that I see here Air Canada better rethink it's Rouge airline set up before it loses all of its customers.,Detractor

" Singapore to Venice via Istanbul. Cabin crew on both legs attentive and friendly. They came to me at the end of both segments to ask whether I liked the service and enjoyed the flight. Old business class seat on the Singapore to Istanbul route: this seat type should be removed by Turkish as it is uncompetitive. Had a good sleep though as the space for legs is excellent. Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine on-demand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their long-haul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual - looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October.

  Flew three sectors in total with AirAsia. Booked online and checked in online well in advance. We were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. I booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety.

"  Honolulu to San Francisco with United Airlines. Flight attendants rude - had multiple flight attendants bump into me with carts with no apologies. Offered 1 complimentary soda, with optional water now and then. Seat tv controls were located on top of the armrest which provided no room for my arms to rest without adjusting multiple aspects of tv. That was only if the any type of entertainment was offered for the 6 hour flight. Had to use my ipad for entertainment. On the way back they would not offer internet due to unavailable for transocean flight, (even though it was on the previous flight to Hawaii) which price for both flights were identical. United offer a direct tv option only with excessive credit card charges. It should also be mentioned that they even showed pricing for flights that were over 2 hours were charged more per movie. Boarding agent almost would not to let me take my normal sized carry on, due to space limitations. When all I had was on small bag that fit in all there metal measuring racks.

The recline was really good and made the flight really comfortable and the legroom was great as I could stretch out fully (I'm 5""8). The meals were delicious a lot better than the meals served on other long haul flights. The entertainment was excellent and included a wide range of new movies and it had videos about KLM and what it does to help our world and it surely was impressive. The cabin crew were really friendly and had a smile on their faces which made the flight more pleasant.

But soon after pushed back, the aircraft returned to its parking position due to electrical problem, resulting in one hour delay. Upon took-off all passengers who sat in business class asked the cabin crew to convert our seats to bed mode because it was an after midnight flight. We slept for about 5 hours and were woken up by the FA for breakfast, whereas our daughter was left sleep until half an hour before landing in Sydney. The meals were tasty and glasses were filled up frequently. FA were friendly, except one stewardess looked not so interested in serving us. We landed in Sydney only 20 minutes behind schedule. Inbound flight : Check in process went very fast and served by a friendly ground staff. Boarding was also on time.

" Toronto to Oslo via Warsaw in business class. After my wife and I settled into our spacious seats, I began to relax. The pitch of the BC seats is the longest I have seen, and the seat is flat for sleeping. I had no trouble sleeping a few hours on the night flight to Europe. Mind you since Poland is probably not a first world country of the highest standard of living, the food served even in BC was just OK. It wasn't excellent by any means, but it wasn't awful either. They try as hard as they can in their service, even if it is not always with a smile. The amenity kit was very basic, the movie choice was limited. I found the lavatory spacious and clean. The flight from Warsaw to Oslo was also delayed by 30 minutes. On the way home, Oslo to Warsaw arrived ten minutes early, and then Warsaw to Toronto left on time and again we touched down ten minutes early. In summary, I can guarantee you will find a more solid Star Alliance airline such as EVA, ANA, Air Canada, Lufthansa, but LOT will not be one of your worst flying experiences either. If you are lucky to use their BC cabin, you will find a seat with enormous pitch and leg room, and for me sleep and rest quality trump the food or alcohol or service or movies, so I was satisfied enough.",Passive

"  London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday, flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class, I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew, we paid the Â£48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA's new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5'5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5'10). Although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn't get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller, you wouldn't have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy â€“ water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However, during food service another drink was also offered. So, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didn't have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us, we couldn't recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn't really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn't use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE â€“ I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some â€œmeâ€ time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there â€“ whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However, the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time â€“ I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don't the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? On leaving the plane I did have a look at Business Class, and without offending regular Business Class users, I did wonder exactly what you get for your money.

Their lounges at Hong Kong Airport are outstanding - there are 6 of them!

I'm trying to remain professional and be understanding, I would happily pay a fee to have the changes made but I am not in a position to forfeit the $ for an airline ticket that could still be used. Someone please help me understand why this is so difficult to do? If I conducted my business in this way, I would be out of business. I would not recommend to my friends and family to travel with Alaska Airlines. This is not how you treat your customers. All I want to do is change the name on the ticket.",Detractor
"  I flew from Baltimore to Atlanta on July 1st, and I had a connecting Delta flight to Amsterdam. I arrive in Atlanta at 1730 hours and was expected to go from Terminal A to Terminal F in 15 minutes which is impossible. Now it gets worse, no one in the Atlanta Customer service could help me they said pick up the courtesy phone and try to get another flight. The lady on the phone says they can not get me out of Atlanta until July 5th. I stayed on the phone for over an hour while she tries to find me a earlier flight. I said you are going to put me in a hotel for 2 days with no food. All I hear is I am sorry. She found a flight on July 3rd at 10:30pm. Then, they had to make another connection from Amsterdam to Kiev Ukraine final destination. I arrived at 0030 July 4th. I had a lot of family wondering where I was. They waited 12 hours for me. Maybe combining Air France, KLM and Delta is too much for 1 airline to handle. I was very disappointed with Delta.",Detractor

Cancelled flights, delayed for 31 hours. Herded like cattle around the airport, made to wait for hours collecting luggage and checking into overnight hotels. As a frequent flyer this was the worst experience I have encountered. All this and not one Finnair representative present who was prepared to offer support or an apology. It was chaotic, shambolic and inexcusable. I am hoping that Finnair can redeem themselves with the aftercare. It's a shame because service on the plane was excellent.",Detractor
"  Washington to Phoenix via Denver. I had heard that Frontier Airlines had a poor record for on-time flights, but was able to get a good discount on tickets for 5 people. Not worth it to save $750. We had delays on both legs of our trip, lies, different stories on reason for delay, 8 gate changes. An entirely frustrating experience, which caused us to arrive five hours late in PHX. My husband, my children and I were exhausted. We ended up easily spending the $750 that we saved on tickets on cabs, food and entertainment in airport, and most of all frustration. Do not go for the cheap flight, you WILL regret it. I spoke with at least seven different people who were flying Frontier for the first time last night, all said they will never use this airline again. They sent us a $25 discount each on any flight via email, but I will never use the discounts. You get what you pay for.",Detractor

After an hour Of standing in view of her I asked for an update. She picked up the phone, made a call and said ""I'm sorry sir. Your ipad is lost. There's nothing I can do"". No other info was provided. It took 4 days of trying to contact KLM to figure out I should have logged a missing item report with Schiphol lost and found.

"I I was in Milan airport 12pm waiting for my flight to Cairo by Egyptair flight at 6pm. I've been waiting for my flight until 10pm when the crew decide to cancel our flight to next day at 2:30pm. They manipulated us for 4hrs until they announced the cancellation of the flight and booked us an hotel 1hr away from the airport. We were at the hotel by 00am and we had to checkout by 11 and take a bus to the airport by 12pm Friday for the flight at 2:30pm. The hotel announced that we would have our lunch at 12pm same time of the departure from the hotel and nobody from egyptair showed up, the bus came at 2 and we were at the airport at 3pm where we found there was not a flight at 2:30pm - the next flight was 6pm were fully booked and not enough seats for everyone so we should wait for another plane either at 9pm or 12:10am on Saturday. The Egyptair representative refused to return us to any hotel and offered me either to wait for a 12:10am flight or he would book an hotel and take next day flight and that was what I have chosen. He refused as is not worth it to stay in hotel for next day while I can wait much longer at the airport for night flight. The flight came at 11pm and ready for take off at 00am, but the flight has been delayed again to 1am. We had the worst plane ever, uncomfortable seats, unwelcomed crews and dirty.

"I have never had such a bad experience on a plane in my life. I was coming back to Atlanta from the Bahamas with American Airlines but I had a connecting flight through Miami. Getting onto the plane they made me check my carry-on because they had reached capacity (even though I was in the second group). I was hesitant doing so but I did as they asked. When we landed I waited for an hour and half in baggage claim before they told me where it was. They had left the bag in Miami because the plane was too heavy and couldn't carry anymore bags. (They didn't even tell me they were doing this.) The worst part was that I was going to the Auburn Alabama game in the morning and my ticket was in that bag so I had to miss the game. Also the rest of my family's bags were scuffed, one of the bags had the zipper ripped off and the pocket in the front ripped off as well. They asked if American Airlines would fix it or replace it and they refused to do either. The fact that I am actually taking the time to write this review is how angry I am.

I am a frequent traveller between Toronto and Orlando (at least twice a month). When Air Canada added this route to its Rouge system I knew I would have a problem. The seats in business class are terrible the food is awful and the legroom is non-existent. However the price for a business ticket remains the same! This is what happens when there is no other way to travel (business class) directly between Toronto and Orlando. The staff are helpful but they know with every flight most passengers will be disappointed. If you are trying to compete with discount airline charge discount prices. I pray that a competitor enter this route in the near future. I will move over immediately!,Detractor
" I understand why they call it WOW air now. This is the worst of the worst! I am a very seasoned traveler, and I have never encountered such an inept series of errors that caused me to move my flight a week before travel, get refused boarding at check-in, and be forced to fly on Icelandair. Their customer service is atrocious, their policies are purposely deceptive, and the entire experience was tantamount to theft. I was traveling from Los Angeles to Reykjavik. A week before flying I received an email stating that the flight on Jan 31 was ""seriously delayed"" and to call customer service to arrange a new date. A new date? That's called a cancellation! After spending 20 minutes waiting for their Indian call center to answer, the lady would only tell me the flight was delayed indefinitely, however, if I could book through Chicago at the same cost since there were no other flight options for me that same date (WOW has only one flight per day from LAX, and not each day) I could get myself to Chicago before their 4.50 pm departure with nominal effort on United since I couldn't change my vacation dates. I was told to file a claim via their website to have any consideration of refunding the difference between flying from LAX and Chicago, especially since they charged me an additional $12 to have an assigned seat. After several attempts to file a claim and arguing via Facebook with their customer service, they admitted that their website didn't have a claim service, so they sent me a link via email saying they would get back to me within 72 hours. It's now 11 days with no response. I get to Chicago, but their check-in is only open 3 hours prior to boarding. I try to check-in, but they refuse to check me because my passport name was different than what was on my ticket (Tim versus Timothy). They tell me to step aside to call customer service to have it corrected since the gate agents can't do anything. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, the guy spends another 15 minutes making me hold before telling me there is nothing he can do because their policy does not allow changes within 4 hours of boarding. So, if you have any type of issue, they can't help you since they open three hours before boarding. So, I'm left stranded in Chicago. The best part is that the flight was delayed 1.5 hours, so technically my change was within the four hour window, but they wouldn't help me. The good news is I found my way to Icelandair, and had a very pleasant experience because they had a flight that left at 6.40pm. The agent told me when I bought the ticket that they get a lot of business from people kicked off WOW at the last second. Another funny thing is WOW sent me a customer service request via email, but their link failed! Bottom line: Do yourself a favor and take Icelandair to Iceland. WOW is totally incompetent.",Detractor

It's great value for money and I definitely recommend it to anybody who considers flying with them. I am 100% positive I will be flying them again.,Promoter

"  Manila to Houston via Beijing. Beware Air China On the second week of a five-week visit to the Philippines, ITN travel agency informed me by email that our return flight on Sept 1 was cancelled by Air China without explanation. I was given the option to fly on Sept 2. I agreed, but never received confirmation. Since I booked through a travel agency, Air China would not let me access their website to get seat assignment, flight status, or communicate with them. So I emailed ITN almost every day the next two weeks for confirmation but they said Air China still had not resolved the problem. They gave me a phone number to call in California because Air China needed passport info, ID, etc, which I know they already had. I use my cellphone but every time I press 1 for English, I got cut off. When I used a landline to call long distance twice, I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I gave up. I finally flew to Manila from Davao province where I was staying and went to the airport at 4:00 AM to avoid traffic, and cut through a long line to an Air China counter. After a lengthy explanation, I was given confirmation and had to wait another 15 minutes to get a copy because the copier was in the fourth floor. September 2 we were finally on our way with stopover in Beijing. There, they had mechanical problems and flight to Houston was delayed four hours and we missed our connection. In Houston IAH, Air China offered no meal voucher, no hotel accommodations, or taxi fare. We were left on our own. No help at all from Air China personnel. Next day we flew to Charlotte via United Airlines, two days beyond our original schedule. The money we saved could not compensate for the stress, no sleep, and exhaustion I went through.

" I was traveling with colleagues from Boston to NE Arkansas, via O'Hare. We were supposed to have a 1.5 hour layover. Our flight from Boston to Chicago was delayed by an hour due to weather. No problem, these things happen. Usually when flights are delayed by that much the airline makes a special attempt to help travelers who need to make connections. But as we approached landing in Chicago they made no mention of connecting flights. They did not ask if anyone needed to rush off the plane to make a flight. They did not announce whether there were gate changes for connecting flights. I was at the back of the plane. Others I were traveling with were further up front. They ran ahead to the gate, which was in another wing of the terminal, a 10 minute walk, 6 minute run. I followed as soon as I got off the plane. Of course the gate was changed but no one at the old gate, when I finally got there, knew where the new gate was, so that took 3 minutes to locate it. My traveling companions who got to the correct gate first told the gate attendants that I was right behind them. But still they closed the jetway door seconds before I arrived and refused to open it. They had nothing to say, just pointed me to the customer service desk. The flights themselves were fine, comfortable, but the lack of customer focus, common courtesy, and most importantly the lack of helpful service on the delayed flight is emblematic of a company that just doesn't care. No attempt was made to help avoid the problem to begin with by asking if anyone had to rush due to the delay. No calls were made to the connecting gate to tell them that passengers were on their way. No attempt was made to help at the gate. And no apology was given at the service desk. It was a full team effort across numerous American employees to demonstrate that they couldn't care less about me as a customer. Pathetic. Also, JetBlue and Virgin both have free Wifi. American, nope. Gotta pay Gogo for really lousy bandwidth.",Detractor

"Las Vegas to London with British Airways was awful. We were in first class, travelling with 2 young children and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight, and we had booked a row of 4 seats so we could sleep one child one adult. We check in at first class which was delayed, as they are busy and have moved some economy passengers to the first class line to speed up things. Then we are told one of our seats has been moved, the staff are unsure as to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pass to the lounge. An hour later I go to the check in desk as nobody from BA has been bothered to come - I am then told, actually your seat is broken nothing we can do, and its now my problem. This seat is in the middle, therefore it means either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the 2 children together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin. No other options and British Airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows. We kept the children together behind me, obviously meaning I could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. Then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously. They did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat, alone surrounded by strangers or to move me to the front which would have left my children completely alone. On out outward flight from London to Vegas one of our seats also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey - nothing the cabin staff could do then either.

ZRH-SFO April 26 2014 in First: First Lounge in ZRH excellent very nice decor excellent food and good service. Very good is also the car shuttle to the gate. Flight: Very old layout of cabin seats are very old and dated without any touch of luxury. There is very limited privacy between the seats. The TV screen is very small. The seat adjustment panel shows its age some buttons do not work properly. The toilets have also absolutely no luxury features they look more like economy than first class very limited amenities (only one hand lotion and one face lotion but no lip balm no mouth wash etc.) after some hours they are out of tissues so you have to use paper tissues - very economy style! Amenities OK but again no luxury. The pyjamas are good quality. Food is OK but not on First standard (same choice and quality as Business Class). Limited choice. The chicken had absolutely no taste the rice also tasteless - overall really not good. Good is the quality of the wines. During the flight there is no food available - worse than in Business Class where they serve sandwiches etc. Service very disappointing: 3 empty water bottles remained for more than 5 hours beside me. The maitre de cabin however was nice and tried to accommodate us as much as possible. Overall very disappointing far away from Premium airlines like Emirates Etihad and Singapore Airlines.

"  I have been very disappointed by the service received by this airline. My husband and I fly around 8 times a year and for this trip had upgraded to business class to allow us to sleep. Issue one the first flight was late, there was no communication or organisation of any form by the airport staff. No one had a Clue what was going on and when we would be leaving, we queued up and then told to wait then lined up again, but there was no organisation. For Business class we were expecting a fully reclined seat to allow us to sleep. No. The staff on the flight were rude and no help. When we landed at Reykjavik there was very poor signage and direction to allow us to find our connecting flight. When we eventually did our boarding time came and went, there was an area which had to be emptied of people to then allow us to be checked in. By this time the flight was already delayed with no communication. We approached the airline representative as we were checked in and advised that the organisation was appalling. To which she replied ' I know' and passed us through. When we boarded we were given a shot of fruit juice as we sat down. 45 mins after we were already late we were advised that we were awaiting a passenger and would be waiting a furthe half hour before we departed. A further 45mins later we then started to complete some of the take off routines, and the flight staff were abrupt and not responsive to any queries of the new arrival times. When we arrived in London we then discovered that out luggage had been damaged. After returning home I contacted customer service to explain my disappointment in the service and damaged luggage and was sent the most unapologetic response and damage claim form. I asked to speak to someone on the phone to express my dissatisfaction and was told that they cannot take calls in any circumstances and that I must only follow the claim damage form. I have completed the form and was told it can take up to two weeks for the payment to clear, it has now been over 3 weeks and I have not seen the funds. Customer service and the cabin and ground staff have no interest in you as a customer, even a business class customer. This airline is only interested in profits and taking your money.

I see a lot of negative reviews and honestly in the 19 years I have flown with this airline I have had nothing but good things happen to me. I had to make an international flight in Seattle and I had no trouble at all. The reason why they have open seating is to speed up the boarding process.

"3/4/2014 flight to Dublin. 3 of our group were flying from LAX and one was flying from Denver. Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was ""well you weren't on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal"". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can't spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom.

As soon as she boarded the attendants gave her a bottle of water, then as soon as we took off, she got two gin and tonics, well before any other passenger had been served - did she pay of course not. Then she was given the toasted sandwich (no charge), the cold meat what ever that was (no charge) then the chocolate cookie (no charge), all before any passenger got a inking of being served. The crew and her continued dialogue ignoring the remaining passengers. This type of service really does put off regular full fare paying customers from using their service, we the full fare payers, are subsidizing the friends of crew. What type of message is EasyJet sending out to the world.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern",Detractor

BOG-PTY-BOG. Out in C back in Y. I had never flown AV before but found the service and aircraft configuration to be far better than anticipated. In C the seat is comfortable and has an adjustable leg rest in addition to the recline - a feature usually found only on long haul aircraft. The IFE array in both cabins was extensive and included USB and power at every seat as well as video on demand. In Y the seats also had footrests. The service was excellent and the food was tasty.

Chose to fly Air India from Bhopal to Delhi. It was the last departure for Delhi at 9.30pm. Standard A320 aircraft with approx 60% occupancy. Check in was slightly time consuming inspite of the 2 Air india counters open due to slight rush. Specially demanded for a window seat and got it assigned during check in. The flight departed 10 minutes before time and arrived Delhi approx 10.30pm. Was served a hot dinner on board with veg as the only option which was nice and filling. Accompanied with dessert and salad. Air India is one of those few who still serve in actual steel cutlery and has the best legspace in the skies in economy.

"  On 2nd March 2017 I booked Eurowings return flights from DÃ¼sseldorf to Birmingham UK for myself and my 12 year old daughter. The flights were booked online using my Miles & More Lufthansa account. As usual I printed out my Travel Itinerary documents at home and everything seemed to be correct and as normal. On arrival at DÃ¼sseldorf airport on Sunday 9th April we were faced with one of the longest queues for a Eurowings check-in that I think I have ever seen. After queuing for ages we finally arrived at the check-in desk, only to be turned away by the check in assistant because the name on my Travel Itinerary document did not match the name on my Passport. On close inspection my short first/given name was indeed printed instead of my full name. I explained to the check-in assistant that I booked on-line via the Lufthansa website with my Miles & More Account and even presented my Miles & More membership card which shows my normal full name. This form of identification was not accepted at the Eurowings check-in with the assistant stating that the names differed by more than 3 characters so she could not check me into the flight. I asked if they could simply update the Travel documents based on my Miles & More Card plus Passport. She could not. If I wanted the documents changed I would have to contact Lufthansa. I was sent from the Eurowings check-in desk to the Lufthansa service desk but the woman at the Lufthansa Service desk just said â€œsorry we are only a service desk we can't helpâ€. I was re-directed to the Lufthansa telephone helpline, which also was unable to help. I tried to re-book the flights at the Lufthansa service desk, with a similar reply ""sorry we can't help, we are only a service desk we can't book flights"". Eventually I found L'Tur at DÃ¼sseldorf airport and re-booked the whole journey, with the same start and destination airports, on the same day (but later flights), with the same carrier (Eurowings), this time with the correct full names on the documents for an additional price of â‚¬688. When my daughter and I were finally on-board we were looking forward to a little something to eat and drink, but the steward bypassed us both, i.e. no drinks and nothing to eat. Apparently our tickets were â€œSmart something-or-otherâ€ which means no on-board service. I had hoped the treatment on the return journey would be better. We received nothing to eat or drink. An altogether disappointing treatment for tickets costing over â‚¬1000. I had resigned myself to this being one of those bitter life learning experiences, â€œnext time check that all the details on the documents match up 100%",Detractor
" Athens to Larnaca. Aegean is a very professional airline, I have experienced many many flights with them, aircraft though cramped are in excellent condition, flight attendants are given top marks, whilst snacks etc at least on some routes are getting below average, for example on this flight we were given a tasteless small piece of bread which looked like a pie.. As on many airlines you have to pay for check in luggage, pay for a seat if you choose the first 12 rows etc. In general a punctual and reliable airline, but ever so often they avoid jet step walkways and this is my constant complaint, as it has happened many many times especially on this route to Larnaca, or even Munich and London..

" Worst flight experience I've ever had. When I got to the airport to drop off my bag (after self check in) it took 25 minutes for them to put a sticker on my bag and put it on the belt and I was the first one in line. There were only 3 people working and very long lines and wait times. When I got to the gate to fly out I heard that I would miss my connecting flight I went to talk to gate agents to see what my options are. They were not very helpful the only thing they did was rebook my on a flight for the morning and told me I'd have to figure out my plans once I was in Houston. They were condescending and blaming everything on policy. When I got to Houston, the customer service agents there were very helpful in getting me a room and other accommodations. But when I went to receive my checked bag for the night in the hotel, I was told that I was unable to get the bag and couldn't have access to it til tomorrow. United is the worst airline I have flown, regarding everything from check in to reliability. At the Nashville airport there were 9 total delayed flights and 8 of them were United.

MCO-LHR via Atlanta. The internal flight up to Atlanta was surprisingly spacious seating in economy for this short flight.

YVR-LAX mid-day on an Embraer 190. Everything about this flight was smooth and efficient. The plane itself is worthy of comment: smooth powerful yet quiet. The newish light-construction seats were very night and afforded me a lot more foot room. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this. The fix is easy: have one person out front directing passengers.,Promoter

The seats were very uncomfortable. Many staff were extremely curt. It was a midnight 5 hour flight which was delayed. And they did not serve anything to us for the next 3 hour.

"Our drive to the airport was approximately 6 hours. As we were pulling up we got a phone call that our flight was cancelled. At the counter we were told it was a staff issue but my gut was they just cancelled due to lack of passengers. We had hoped we could make other arrangements that day but that was out of the question. They could 'maybe' get us to our destination the next day, late afternoon after an 8 hour excursion (I believe Denver is a 1 or 2 hour flight from Minneapolis) but there were no guarantees either. No food allowance or room accommodation would be given either. As we were attending a conference this didn't make any sense so we ended up getting a refund. We did find out later there were other flights on other airlines that could of got us there on time, the Spirit staff are not or maybe are not allowed to be that helpful.

"  I recently flew Spirit airlines and given all of the reviews I read prior to my experience, I felt compelled to share my feedback. Firstly, I chose Spirit because I was looking for an economy airline. I went into the experience with eyes wide-open. I knew that Spirit's business model was ""a la carte"" so to speak - baggage, seat selection, priority boarding, boarding pass printing, in-flight snack at an additional cost above the base price. Spirit did not disappoint. My family had a wonderful experience. I started my trip from CLE (Cleveland) to MCO (Orlando). Although my flight was late departing, Spirit kept us informed, unlike many airlines. From MCO, my husband and I flew to FLL (Ft. Lauderdale). The most impressive part of that trip was that Spirit was facing delays due to crew scheduling, however they mitigated the issue by using the same flight attendants from the inbound flight instead of waiting for the originally scheduled flight attendants to arrive. How many airlines do you know that would do that to keep a flight on time? Exemplary service! Then, on our flight back home the handle on my daughter's rolling backpack was broken. She took it into the office at baggage claim and immediately, no questions asked, they offered her a bag replacement and mileage for the hassle. Again, how many airlines do you know who even cover bag damage when it's a handle, wheel or even a tear. For all those Spirit nay-sayers, stop complaining about the ""a la carte"" fees. The airline is founded on those principles. If you want everything included, use one of the high priced airlines. You won't get better service and you'll pay more. If that's your goal, then go for it. If you want an airline who's focused on providing stellar service for an economical price, I'd highly recommend Spirit.",Promoter

Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.,Detractor
"Would be great if baggage showed up. I purchased the ticket via Delta.com as their price was cheaper for this route. I fly enough on SkyTeam to know that inter carrier arrangements can cause some issues, but have not had an experience like this. I checked in at BHM and had all my bags checked all the way through to DXB. When I arrived at DXB, no bags showed up. So after a few mins at the baggage office (who were superb in locating and providing info) we found out that all 3 bags were left behind in ATL. 2 were subsequently routed via CDG & 1 via AMS. I know that logistics are often out of the hands of the airline, but was surprised that 20 hours had elapsed between taking off at ATL and arriving at DXB, so was really surprised that I hadn't been informed via any kind of automated or manual message. Eventually after 36 hours all 3 made it to my destination and all was good. A little about the service. The ATL-CDG 777-200 was OK, nothing bad, but 2x2x2, so not a huge amount of privacy, CDG-DXB on the new 700-300 configuration and seats are great! Plenty of room, giant screen, much better food and service than a couple of years ago. Even the connection in CDG wasn't that bad. Overall a very nice experience. DXB-CDG, again AF metal 777-300 and CDG-ATL an old configuration 767-400 and noticeable less foot room on DLs BC seat than the new AF. Service still good however. I think between AF & DL there isn't much difference in service, so it's all down to personal comfort which I did find better on AF. Arriving at ATL had another baggage nightmare, none of my 3 bags made it again. They were on my flight, but got held in customs. Unfortunately there are some communication problems at Delta as one person said they were on carousel (which clearly they weren't), one person said they were held up in customs (as per the delta.com app update) and one said they were already transferred to my BHM connection. So if they could clean up their internal communication issues and give out reliable info this would help reassure PAX. Eventually arrived at BHM only to find 2 of the 3 bags and one was put on a later flight. At least I got them all back eventually.",Passive

I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations.

Travelled back from Dublin to Leeds on a flight that was supposed to arrive at 17.30 on 31/3/15 but after 2 x attempts at trying to land in Leeds we were eventually diverted to Liverpool. This was due to strong winds and was a safety precaution fair enough I hear you say. This isn't really my gripe but the after care.

After being kept waiting she eventually told us that some coaches were being arranged what happened to the one that were a few minutes away?

We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for â‚¬3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.",Passive

"Flew with Cathay Pacific from Paris to Sydney, staying overnight in Hong Kong. Both flights were full but boarding was efficient. Decent leg room and I didn't feel squashed at all even with the seat in front of me reclined back (I am very short though, so that helps). Food was pretty good, there were three options with the main meals, including one vegetarian option. The service was excellent on both legs. On the Hong Kong - Sydney route I pressed the call button for some coca cola and the attendant was at my seat in 10 seconds. They happily filled my water bottle up too. Entertainment wasn't amazing but there were enough movies and TV shows to keep you occupied. Very bumpy flights with lots of turbulence but what can you do. I will definitely fly with Cathay again.",Promoter
First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,Passive
Even though we enjoyed the convenience of the 5 minutes walk between our parking spot and the check-in counter at Trenton Airport having to pay for any checked luggage and specific seats so my partner and I could seat side by side was vexatious. Flight attendants were very pleasant but the 2-hour wait after disembarking at Hartsfield- Jackson (Atlanta) to get our checked luggage was exasperating.,Passive
A textbook flight with Qantas Airways from Sydney to Auckland. Lounge was good for a decent breakfast and very comfortable. Plane took off a little late but friendly crew and great service made it feel like a seperate cabin - not just a curtain dividing Business from the rest of the plane. Decent wines and food and the flight was quite seemless - a rare chance for some peace and quiet and time to myself. Bags were first off and started coming out of the carousel when I walked up to it. Good to see that Qantas does a relatively short flight as well as it does the long ones.,Promoter

LHR-HEL-BKK return in business class. European sector economy seats are three across with the middle seat blocked off. Dinner and drinks served soon after take-off from London early evening. The meal looked attractive and tasted good. Departure of Bangkok flight is scheduled 55 mins after the London flight arrives. 20 mins after landing I was in my seat for Bangkok. A330-300 business class cabin on the outbound flight a muted grey colour seating is 1-2-1. Each seat has a generous side table seats are on the narrow side and a broad shouldered person might not be comfortable. The fully flat bed is welcome but seat padding not generous. The duvet is thick so folded several times provided a comfortable base for sleeping. The meal was adequate but not outstanding. I did not use the inflight entertainment except to display the map. The return flight seating configuration was 2-2-2 across. It boarded on time but departure delayed 45 mins. The seats again had limited padding and provided only an angled lie-flat bed. Sleeping was uncomfortable. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. In Helsinki the Finnair Lounge is underwhelming. The food selection was uninteresting there was a cash bar for everything except soft drinks and a small wine and beer selection but Wi-Fi was free and the showers excellent. The flight to London left on time. We were seated three across in regular economy seats in front of the dividing curtain. Not the expected ending to an otherwise good service.,Passive

I paid about 75 euros to check one 23kg bag. That is a lot of money for such a simple thing. Every other airline uses 23kg limits. Now I think I understand why they are so limited. Air Baltic's planes are so old and out of date. That plane was something I would have rode on 20 years ago.,Detractor
After reading some reviews we were very concerned with our decision to fly Spirit. We were surprised to have a wonderful experience. The airplane was on time and the personel were nice. The only issue we experienced was baggage check. We prepaid our bags and thought dropping them off before the flight would have been quick and easy. We were wrong. The lines were very long and there was not enough employees to check bags in. We stood in line for almost an hour as the line behind us extended to outside the doors. We would like to have seen and used a skycap. I think adding curb side bag drop off would help to move people through this process much quicker. We did purchase the larger seats since we had a long flight and brought our own food and drinks so we didn't have to worry about buying theirs.,Promoter

  Panama City to Los Angeles. I checked in using the mobile boarding pass. When I arrived at Tocumen they told me that their mobile system doesn't work very well and that they will print me the paper boarding pass. I was told the flight was delayed almost 7 hours but not given any reason. I spent the next 7 hours waiting in the airport which has only one filthy restaurant with terrible food on the outside of security. After being unable to eat and told once I go through security I cannot come out I went through security to find an in a massively overcrowded terminal with no air conditioning and people covered with sweat sitting all over floors waiting 7 hours with nowhere to set with no air conditioning was awful. There were long lines even for the filthy toilets. There was never an explanation or apology from Copa staff. The captain never said a word or even addressed the issue about why the plane was 7 hours late. Many passengers were connecting from other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to the United States and they were very frustrated having to wait an extra 7 hours for their connection to the US.,Passive

" April 2019. I was traveling all around Scotland 3 weeks before my Ryanair flight. I didn't have access to a printer so I couldn't print my boarding pass. I got to the airport 15 minutes late or 1 hour and 45 minutes before my flight, only to find that they were hitting me with a 55 pound penalty. As a senior citizen, I pleaded my case with the ticket agent and she said it was policy not to waive the fee. Now keep in mind the 55 pounds was more than double the price of my ticket. So I said I'm better off just re-booking my flight and not paying the 55 pound fee. They said, ""no you can't do that the flight is booked."" However, if I pay the 50 pounds in addition to what I already paid for the ticket, they can find a seat for me. That was just terrible. They may have robbed me the 55 pounds this time, but do you think I will ever fly that airline again? No way! Not only did they lose a customer, but they lost any future business. Whoever the marketing person is who came up with that policy should be fired. It discriminates against Americans because we don't see this type of fine or penalty for not checking exactly 2 hours before a flight. I flew a different airline on the way back. It's their loss.

"Chicago to Milan return. Lost our luggage on both the outgoing and return flights. Not staying in a hotel made it very difficult to get by without clothing, toiletries, chargers, appliances, converters etc. Spent hours every day on the phone with the airline tracking our bags. Each day they assured us that we would receive them the following day. Actually received luggage on the 5th day out. 3 days before our scheduled return I requested a change for my husband as his father had become ill while we were away. Young girls at the American Airlines kiosk in Milan spoke very little English and could only tell us that ""all flights are full"" and there was no Manager to talk to. I had a broken seat on the return that did not recline. It didn't matter that our luggage was lost again on the return because we were home. What did matter was that after contacting American Airlines about our problems, they did not even respond until the 3rd letter and then told us that it is not their policy to give any compensation for lost luggage unless we had purchased approved items and had saved all receipts. Nothing was given to us outlining these rules.",Detractor

We had already enjoyed P/E on the way over to Europe so thought why not? P/E is well worthwhile and as mentioned for previous flights should be standard. It is just so more comfortable compared with economy but much more affordable than business.

"  Bahrain to Bangkok return via Abu Dhabi in Business. I have been gold with them for some time and always sang their praises. Overall all flights on time and in some cases early. The crews a mix of engaged to those who looked panicky/disorganized to didn't want to be there. Lounge in Abu Dhabi fine, but the airport is creeking at the seems, all flights were by buses with the exception of BKK. Lounge in Bangkok small but fine. It is now evident cost cutting is now severely in place, no more Limos, no more wash bags, cheaper wines and the food onboard is Economy. It was a joke, outbound to BKK was a two egg omelette, with a tomato/ bread and tea. I kid you not, they have reduced the snacks to three offerings being chicken and crisps. The return was soup or mezze, mains were insulting with Biryani (rice), chicken breast with mash or Veg pasta. I must say the outbound crew were super and professional but the return looked like they all hated each other and the atmosphere was evident. Standards are slipping badly but to top it off the attitude of the ground staff has never been good in Abu Dhabi, they all need intense training on customer service and get them engaged or else fire them as they have a rude, lazy, arrogant attitude. One particular was the man boarding the outbound flight to BKK, he snatched my passport, didn't even look at me, was too busy laughing with his colleague and then with out looking at me still, thrust the passport back in my face still laughing with his colleague. That is not acceptable. I was loyal but after this trip not that interested. I'll stick to Emirates or Qatar Airways.",Detractor

Power socket was provided in B777-300ER for laptop and tablet. The only discomfort was the air temperature was a too high on flight from HK to PEK. Our outward flight transfer time was as long as 12 hours, Air China provided free overnight accommondation including shuttle. However, they should improve the online check-in system. We were unable to check-in our outward flight due to some internal error of its online system, but it worked in return flight.

"QR836 Doha to Bangkok new Airbus A380 should have been seat 46c economy but moved for no technical reason to a small economy area on the upper deck right at the back of the aircraft. Seat 27G. I chose seat 46c because of its position forward of the leading edge of the wing which on other 380's such as Emirates and Singapore are both relatively quiet and comfortable in turbulence. This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute. I would love to know why people who book flights five or six moths in advance should be penalised for others that either book last minute or don't check in until the last minute.

Part of the business class cabin on the 747 is located in the upper cabin with 20 seats and two dedicated crew. The seating configuration however is just odd.

"Flew from Miami to London. First time on the A380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777. The World Traveller Plus area is on the upper deck and BA had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft. The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room. The service was the usual British Airways, the cabin crew being friendly and interactive. Overall a good quick flight and would definitely recommend BA but will stick to the 787 which I really love",Promoter
This airline is generally good with friendly staff and good food. Seat spacing in economy class is made for short Asians and probably not for taller Westerners. The leg space is minimal. It also depends on which flight and aircraft you hit you may be lucky (e.g. on route between Thailand and Malaysia) or unlucky (e.g. between Thailand and Pakistan) and hit the most likely worst operating aircraft still in service for Thai airways.,Passive

" Florence to Gatwick. Outward flight left on time luggage arrived cabin crew great so good. Return flight Vueling lived up to their reputation - boarded left sitting there for over an hour after expected departure time announcement. Cabin crew were lovely no complaints. 1 loo blocked so not operational, big queues but not really a drama. The drama when we arrived immediately told at Gatwick no checked bags were loaded because it was too windy & there was a weight issue. I'm lucky after filling in form, global baggage solutions delivered my case today 48 hrs late - my sister who lives in Scotland fingers crossed hers will be delivered too. Dont lie Vueling, your clients are not idiots & we dont appreciate being treated as such, just be honest.",Detractor
"  With the exception of the pitiful food options which we were forced to eat after a disastrous transit through DFW, perhaps the best American Airlines flight I have taken flying from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle. The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer. The other selected an overly loaded virtually inedible turkey and apple croissant sandwich.",Passive
"Qantas from Brisbane to Los Angeles. It was apparent prior to boarding at BNE that this was a very full flight. Upon boarding the cooling system wasn't working and we sat in the plane, melting, for about 20-30 minutes until we were given clearance for take off. Even after take off, it took a while cool down. It was a very long 13 hours to LAX. The IFE had to be re-booted 3 times and the USB ports didn't work. The food was below average even for economy and the seats were terribly uncomfortable. One of the older FA's almost dropped food all over my partner and at one stage he didn't even stop to listen to a simple request. Qantas has really gone downhill.",Detractor

My return flight was scheduled at 11:30, I was there at 10am. All day delay after delay then at 5 pm it was cancelled. I was stranded in a city and was having the worst anxiety and panic attacks. The women at the desk was an angel. She and her coworkers at Lincoln Airport were my saviors. Under a lot of pressure these women handled every situation with patience and calm and believe me there were a ton of upset flyers. I usually don't write reviews but they are worthy. On the other hand I called United and the women on the other end was uncaring . I told her my situation and she said pay for another ticket. I responded with I don't have the money, she said "" well then I can't help you"" and hung up on me. It was then I went to the counter and the agents helped me. I was given a hotel and food for the night (which was very much appreciated ). These women under such stress handled it amazing. As far as United itself I am not sure of future use.",Detractor
"I used to love Continental, the service was consistently above average and the flight experience was satisfactory, if not enjoyable. Since the merger with United I feel the benefits have been reduced, the services have been cut or monetized. This has created a tough environment for your employees to maintain good service. That being said, I was very impressed by the agent at the gate during boarding. Our flight was overbooked and my 8 year old son and I were seated in different rows. With no incentives to give to other passengers she found a way to get us seated together. Once aboard I was surprised to find that the flight did not include any type of in-flight entertainment, no screens and no audio. I gladly purchased it on the 5+ hr flight from EWR to PHX, but this was not even an option on the return. I was also surprised that there was NO safety demonstration given on the flight, which is definitely unsafe and possibly in violation of FAA rules. Lastly, the variety and quality of food available for purchase was poor. After flying over 250,000 miles with Continental/United, when possible I now actively avoid and will pay higher fares to select other airlines that offer better service.",Detractor
The 777 kills it. The expected A380 between Kuala Lumpur and Dubai was switched a few day ago for the Boeing 777. What a let down. Yes the A380 is great but the seating on most 777s does not provide enough space and I am a normal shape. The idea of sitting at an angle or hugging the next guy for 7 hours does not appeal to me enough to change airline which will offer me a wider seat. The 777 is a gold mine for the airline but not suited too narrow for an extra seat.,Passive

The A330-300 from Istanbul to Singapore seemed old. The touch screens were not working normally, only with the remote that made navigation uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment was really good though. It would have been nice if cabin crew would have offered drinks and snacks during the flight in addition to the dinner and breakfast served. On the way back from Singapore to Istanbul we were seated in the isle and it was just so cold, I was sitting with a hat, scarf, sweater, cardigan, blanket on me and my wool coat way over my head and I still got sore throat.",Detractor

"  I had originally booked a noon-ish flight, since we live outside the GTA. Got notification early on of a flight change to an 8.15 am flight, on the Airbus 319 (don't remember what the original aircraft was), which meant we had to stay overnight in Toronto, to avoid getting up before 3 am and risking traffic (additional $150 cost). Terrible flight. It was full, so could not book other seats. Although check-in with online and onsite kiosks was relatively painless. Seats are minuscule and jammed together. I am 5'3"" and I was cramped. No inflight entertainment, except iPad to rent at $10 per. Nowhere to charge our own devices, although some online articles indicate there had been upgrades to the Airbus. Never saw the flight attendants, except at the exit door - no water, no drinks, no food even offered. Happily, we brought our own food and water, as we guessed the food would be too expensive anyhow, and I had read it was poor quality ($3+ for bottled water - really!).

I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA.

Garuda are now using the SKY PRIORITY Lounge in Terminal-4 and this is much better as there is loads of space and a very good selection of hot and cold food and drink. The boarding gate was vey close to the lounge and the boarding process was well controlled. As it was a night flight I was able to get between 5~6 hours sleep. The cabin crew when I awoke were on hand to offer food and drinks and nothing was any problem for them.

My wife and I flew from Almaty to Paris through Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen last year. It was a good experience overall. The plane was relatively new and the crew was really nice. I did not enjoy the space for legs which was really small and I had trouble to spread out my legs and have a little nap. When we arrived in Istanbul all the passengers who had connecting flights faced the worst level of service from Pegasus ticketing agents. Around 150 passengers were in transit and some of them had to catch another Pegasus flight that was leaving in less than an hour. There were only 2-3 agents printing boarding passes to these passengers. It was a mess shortly speaking. We really didn't worry too much because our flight was 5 hours from the moment of landing. Other than that I really liked Pegasus and people should not expect the world class service comfort or facilities when they buy their tickets. It is a good value for money.,Passive

In the end, the AA manager made some phone call to figure out how to issue our boarding pass and check in our luggage. They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology.

We talked to the United person at the gate which he changed our seats and were very helpful in accommodating and put us together. Once on the plane for the 11hr flight home the flight attendants were very rude. At one point we were snapped at because we hadn't filled out the entry to the US card on time. I believe she screamed at us and said â€œyou had 11 hours to do this.â€ Never been on a flight with such a display of rudeness from flight attendants. Do not believe I will be using this airline in the future!",Detractor

Hong Kong-Paris via Beijing. Price of this trip was excellent. The first 3 flights were on comfortable planes while the final leg from Beijing to HKG was on an old leased Air Macau plane which was rather cramped. Food isn't great but flights were on time and the air hostesses excellent. Movie selection is spartan but I took an ipod so didn't mind. The one curious policy is that Air China keep the fasten seat belt signs on throughout the flights. Would certainly fly again if price remains at least $HK 1500 lower than its competitors.,Promoter
" Flew Dallas to San Diego. American Airlines customer service has gotten worse over the past year, and it is unfortunate. This last trip, I had an issue with my luggage, which was my fault, but the customer service to help me remedy the situation was dismal. 5/6 people I spoke to in various capacities were all unfriendly, misinformed and not helpful. To make matters worse, I saw various other people throughout my adventure of acquiring my bags having a similar experience. Once lady coming to the US from Australia for a funeral had the bag-checker say ""give me the bag, we fly everywhere"" without tagging it, of course it was lost. In short, I would like people to know that American Airlines economy class is now comparable to Spirit Airlines in terms of accommodations and worse customer service.",Detractor

Not long after that it got delayed 3 other times for a final time of 9:06pm as the departure time. Around 5:30pm I checked the app for an update and there was a red box saying cancelled. Spirit airlines didn't even send out an email alerting me of the cancellation nor did they try to call and contact me. If I wouldn't have been constantly checking the app, I wouldn't have known about the cancellation. When I called to get a new flight and change the airport I was flying into because i has somebody to pick me up there, Spirit wanted me to pay a â€œfair transfer feeâ€. What? You cancel my flight and don't alert me which is an inconvenience to me and I miss an important doctors appointment because of it and now you want me to pay for your negligence when I'm just trying to get home? I don't think so. On top of all this, calling your customer service line is garbage and might be more frustrating. To anybody reading this, Do not, do not ever book a flight with Spirit airlines even if your life depended on it.

"Having read the reviews about Finnair, I must say I had reservations about flying them. But with a very competitive price for business class to Europe and a shorter flight to Europe (~11 hours from Singapore to Helsinki, as opposed to 13-14 hour to western Europe), it was worth a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. Finnair's offering was no fireworks, but certainly solid. The service was courteous and prompt, and their multicultural staff are friendly but a little on the reserved side. The A340 I was on has undergone refurbishment and was equipped with lie-flat seats. A little hard on the shoulders when sleeping but more than adequate for the rest of the flight. The food was palatable, but nothing spectacular. IFE screens were large, crisp, and responsive, but the selection of films were noticeably limited compared to other major airlines (such as Qantas or Singapore Airlines). As a bonus, the flagship Finnair lounge in Helsinki was stunning with classic Scandinavian chic: stylish and modern. For the amount I paid, it was definitely great value. Would definitely fly again.",Promoter
"An overall pleasant experience. I upgraded to Delta Comfort+ on the first leg of the journey and chose seats right behind first class bulkhead. There was more than ample leg room. The Comfort+ seats also recline a little further as well, and include priority boarding and free drinks. At ANC airport, there were several other airlines with lines that seemed to go on forever, I think one of them was American. There was no line for Delta and the check in agents were friendly. Flight left on time, landed in ATL on time, and our connecting fight to Miami in a different terminal also was on time. While the MD-80 on the second leg was clean, and seemed to have been refurbished, I do not enjoy flying on those older planes as the cabin pressure is horrible. All bags arrived.

Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal.

"  London Gatwick - Pisa Return. Another less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe."" A disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale. FAs in both directions were splendid. They get very embarrassed about talking about BA cutbacks. Who wouldn't?

"Denver to London via Chicago with American Airlines. Our flight from Denver to Chicago was delayed due to weather. That's understandable. The delay caused us to miss our originally scheduled flight from Chicago to London, so I waited in line at the gate counter to re-book on a later flight from Chicago to London that we'd be able to make, based on the delay. Several of us on the flight were attempting to connect to London, and the later flight was filling up fast. Luckily I was near the front of the line. And then the gate agent upped and disappeared on us. Just walked away without saying anything to the person at the front of the queue. We thought we'd gone to the restroom or something and would be back. No - gone. The other agent didn't appear to notice or care when we pointed out this ridiculous behavior. After queuing back up at the end of the other line and finally getting some service, the later flight was full, of course. Delayed our vacation by a day and a half. No compensation. The flights themselves were OK, once we were actually on some flights. But I'll pay more to avoid American in the future. Too many awful customer service experiences with them.",Detractor

"Tijuana to Mexico City. The Aeromexico boarding process is very inefficient by the desk staff as well as by cabin crew. Flight attendants are not interested in helping passengers to accommodate the luggage. The groups for boarding make no sense and make the process inefficient. There are aspects of the onboard experience that are no better in Aeromexico when compared to a low-cost carrier and it does not justify paying higher prices - for example, the service and attitude of crew, space between airplane seats, no food onboard (at least Volaris sell this), poor baggage allowance (Interjet allow 2 pieces of 25 kg, and Aeromexico 1). The only advantages perceived were quicker check in counter and the ability to take a ""carry-on"" on the plane, which in the end was no advantage, because these had to go down to the aircraft hold for lack of space. In short, the service in Aeromexico is not much better than a low-cost airline.",Passive

The main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from UK to Tirana, otherwise nothing special to recommend. Both flights on time.",Passive
"Madrid to Abu Dhabi via Rome, and I was a bit worried about flying with Alitalia, but it wasn't that bad. The leg from Madrid to Rome was as with any other European airline. Small snack and drink served during the flight. The flight Rome to Abu Dhabi on an A330 was pleasant as well. IFE system with a fair choice of movies and music. Cabin crew were not very friendly and couldn't see them during the flight. They disappeared after serving dinner. Dinner was ok, I had pasta and wasnt too bad. Seat pitch very average.",Promoter
Flew Economy on 21 Dec Bangkok to Abu Dhabi (on Boeing 777) and then Abu Dhabi - Brussels (on Airbus 330). Having flown many airlines I found the Etihad experience very good. Indeed as many other reviews also underline the Boeing 777 had somewhat less spacious seats than the A330 but was nevertheless much better than many other (and more expensive) airlines. Flights were very smooth - cabin crew seemed to compete for excellence! Will definitely fly Etihad again.,Promoter
" I don't normally fly with Air New Zealand. However, today I completed two sectors on Air New Zealand (NZ102 and NZ101). The first sector I did in economy in a B787-9 and the second in Business class in a B777. I can't speak highly enough of the professionalism and service of Air New Zealand. Absolutely everything was well done. The lounge is beautiful and comfortable with plenty of well prepared high quality and tasty food (some of it prepared by chef right in front of you!). On the first sector I travelled in seat 37C on a 'works' economy ticket. The seat was comfortable, adequate leg room (I'm 178 tall and 90kg male) and the lunch served was a choice of osso bucco with mash and green beans, or cold roasted chicken breast salad (which was excellent!) followed by brownie and ice cream, yum! On the second sector, I was in seat 2A business premium. The seats are angled slightly away from the windows in such a way to give full aisle access from all seats, yet quite good privacy. They are wider than many business seats. Breakfast was amazing, a choice too wide to list but listen to this, fried eggs and bacon on an aeroplane? Really good stuff that I've not seen on any other! Coupled with the second-best inflight entertainment I've experienced (second to ICE), an excellent airline!",Promoter

Milwaukee to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Terrible seats were like sitting on a sheet of hard plastic. The seats do not recline. There were extra fees for carry-on and seat fees.

  Melbourne to Abu Dhabi on business class on an old Boeing 777 that has seen better days. Plane basically left on time & arrived ahead of schedule at Abu Dhabi which was nice. On board crew were very polite catered to your needs. Toilets were kept clean which was a blessing. Food was just average though & nothing to write home about. IFE is woefully behind the likes of Qatar in terms of movie releases & variety of choice. Tried the onboard WiFi but really it's very slow & eats up your allotment very quickly so be warned if you decide to give it a go..it's a bit of a con to get extra money from your pocket. Really on good for texting or iMessaging. As for the business class seat it's average but it's a lot better on their Boeing 787. On this 777 it's very cramped & claustrophobic. This flight was just an average flight getting from A to B on time with no nasty issues.,Passive

On the return flight the captain paid a visit to the economy section and talked and joked with a number of the passengers.

 Boston to Orlando . This by far is the worst airline I have ever flown. Pre registering online for boarding passes and check bags was a nightmare.

The person at the check in counter was rude and told us to hurry up we had plenty of time.Because of the crazy long wait In the bag line we missed our flight.

"Albuquerque, NM to San Antonio, TX via Dallas, Love Field TX. I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted. So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio. No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say). We just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. Did Southwest get new management? Is this a new marketing scheme?",Detractor
My trip from Toronto to Bogota has not happened yet as the connecting flight from Toronto to Dallas was delayed due to mechanical problems based on what we were told and they did not allow us to board the flight. The AA reps had us wait in front of different counters for more than 5 hours without resolving anything to more than 20 people. In addition they had to handle the receiving flights. The staff was rude and not friendly at all. I gave up and agreed to have my trip delayed by one day losing one entire day in my vacation plans. I hope today it will be different.

"We flew Ottawa-Toronto-San Francisco and returned Los Angeles-Toronto-Ottawa, business class on all trips. The flights to and from Toronto to Ottawa were uneventful. The food served was a fruit plate. The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road.

"  Atlanta to Boston. The website sends you around in circles while it tries to upsell you. Oh, you want to bring a carry-on? it'll cost you. Oh, you want to sit in a seat? $32 please. Then when you finally get to your object, ""check me in,"" the screen turns white and you have to start over. This happens innumerable times, in fact until you accept one of the 'upgrades.' When you call them you go on hold for 15 minutes. When a representative finally answers, she drops your call. They delay your return flight twice and then cancel it. You are stranded in Boston. They do not have friendly relations with other airlines, so they can't put you on a flight with another carrier. They offer you a ride home the following day, Boston to Atlanta, with layovers at Denver and LAX. It departs at 9am and arrives at 6pm - if it arrives. Do you believe them at this point, even if you are such a fool as to accept these terms - 9hrs Boston to Atlanta? They will not give you a hotel voucher for your overnight in in Boston. There is no full refund for your cancelled flight. Your flight to Boston, according to their math - it's not on the receipt - was $120. Your return to ATL was $60. They offer you the $60.

AKL to Hong Kong [partial return of my July journey]. Airbus 340/300 with the coffin like seats I have commented on before. I struggle to see why Cathay are a 5* airline. Again I find the service to be OK but just OK. I missed out on a pre take off drink because no one noticed I had arrived and sat down. After that the service is functional but not pro active. You needed to get up and ask for anything and again I saw no cabin walk through. This was a 12 hour mid day flight so they served lunch and then after 6 hours [with 6 to go] they served dinner which very few wanted [most were asleep] and then after the main course that was it - nothing more. Strange. The next part of the journey home is later today this will be the new business class on the Boeing 777. Overall if the price was very good then I would use them again but other far east and middle east airlines are ahead of the game. Not overly impressed mainly because of the lack of service.,Passive

Not something that I had ever heard of before - nor as you can imagine something that they promote when enticing you to buy their flexible ticket. Complete scam. They very kindly offered to: 1. allow me to pay the difference to the different booking class - what a scam! 2. go on a wait list for this booking class Lots of other business class seats available on the flight but no chance that this is what they will do. I asked if I could speak with someone who could help me - I had paid a lot of money after all so thought that this was unreasonable. I was told I could, but that the answer would be the same. When I said that I would still like to, I was then told that I actually couldn't because no one was there but i could wait on hold for up to 6 hours. I asked to go on the wait list and before I had pretty much finished saying the words I was hung up on.

"  Dublin to Alicante. To start I decided to bring my wife on a short break of 5 nights to Alicante for our upcoming 10 year wedding anniversary.I thought that I would book a holiday with 2 of our friends and without the kids which is the first time ever. We booked flights to Alicante flying from and back to Belfast for the 21-26 Sept 17 only to be emailed that due to operational commitments that the flights are cancelled. We got compensated and sorted things out, no big deal. We book for Dublin and arrive that day nearly 4 hours early only to be told that due to technical faults our flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours give or take. We got over that as going on a holiday even though we knew that because of their delay we were going to miss out on a full night in our apartment. The real mess started when we boarded the plane. To start we were on the same row 13 with 2 of us on each side. The group of people sitting behind us were drunk when they were allowed on board and they sat directly behind our rows about 3 to 4 rows on each side and the worst was sitting right behind my seat. She was in her mid 40's and I couldn't believe the filthy language coming out of her mouth in such a small enclosed area. She was making constant burping noises, cursing, everything that she had to say was shouted or screamed and constant sexual remarks to the male passengers across and behind her. The head flight attendant knew these people were full of drink because before the flight even took off they were shouting and roaring so she comes down a row in front of us and starts telling them that she can take anyone she wants off now who are acting to loud or she has the power to divert the plane at any stage if she feels fit and then disappeared straight away and left the customers to listen to the filth for the rest of the flight (Unbelievable). Just before take off another flight attendant asked me was I ok and I turned around and said to her was she kidding me and with that also disappeared. Again same thing happened during the flight. So we keep there the whole flight listening to this when 10 mins before landing the head flight attendant comes down to me and says are we ok which I really couldn't believe just 10 mins to go so I tell her everything and said that it was a disgrace and she then says that people who were sitting 2 rows up from us that she moved them to the front of the plane because of the noise and brutal language. This I couldn't believe as we were directly in front of the noise which I let her know. During all this my wife starts to cry infront of this attendant because of how upset she was that we were left there for the flight listening to all that was going on. In getting off the plane I also let the captain know and told him that it was a joke that he let them on the plane in the first place.

SFO to SLC and SLC to LAX in First. Old Airbus 320 on first leg. Interesting no life vests on board just the 'buoyant' seat cushion. Newish 737-800 on leg to LAX.

LH1785 Ankara to Munich and then onto Manchester. Not great the airline gave away my pre-booked seat with extra room. Not good considering I paid extra for it. Fortunately the check-in staff managed to sort me out a replacement. The airbus was not too bad the crew were very helpful. The inflight meal was absolutely dreadful. Neither I nor the crew could determine what form of protein it was. The horrible food and the airline giving my seat away soured what would have been a reasonable flight. I fly on business a great deal but not with Lufthansa again if I can help it.,Passive
We took four long haul flights with Singapore Airlines in June and July and were frankly disappointed. On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!,Detractor
" Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"". Very bad customer service.",Detractor

 Scranton to Salt Lake City via Philadelphia. I have to say how happy I am with American Airlines. I have been using this airline to fly my children from Utah to NY for several years. This weekend and 3 weekends ago I had 2 different incidents with my 15 year old. Traveling by herself it was alarming to hear she did not make her flights (both times). American Airlines went above and beyond to accommodate her to make sure she was safe and well taken care of. They arranged another flight for her and kept me posted each time. They took good care of her as well as myself (who as you can imagine was filled with worry). I will continue using them with the trust that my family will always be safe and well taken care of.,Promoter
"Washington Dulles to San Francisco, and United Airlines Ground staff helpful with getting bags tagged and dropped off in crowded and cramped Dulles terminal on busy travel day. Friendly welcome by FA when getting on plane, and at least 2 food and beverage runs, plus additional water and coffee runs, done in a professional and often friendly manner. While there were several vegetarian options, wish there was a veggie breakfast wrap or bowl offered. Economy Plus seat had plenty of leg room, but I'm not a big fan of the vinyl/leather seats, which got to be uncomfortable on 5+ hour flight. Didn't pay the $7.99 for AVOD - wish it was free, but somewhere over the Rockies regretted my decision and wished I had to make the flight go faster (God forbid I should have to read a book for 5 hours). Bathroom in back of the plane was ok, but sink of one of them was out of order and covered by tape, and an insufficient number of handiwipe packets were strewn on the counter (would have been good to have them in a bowl and more of them). Departed a few minutes late, but arrived about 15 minutes early. Overall a good flight.",Passive

Travelled Tunisair only as the price was cheaper than other airlines. Unfortunately this showed in the service.

A380 London - Dubai Melbourne to London via Dubai. Paid A$90 for exit row seat on each leg which I think is reasonable and definitely worth it for extreme long haul. Although I chose row 79 which fronts a main galley and is very noisy I'd avoid this row in future. Food was the real surprise - Qantas have done away with all the dinner accessories (biscuits salad cheese chocolate etc) and instead serve much bigger main portions and they were actually amazing very impressed. IFE also very good. Around 100 Oscar winning movies going back to 1970 plus recent releases and full series of TV shows which is great.

"  Washington to Frankfurt. Solid flight overall. Flight departed not on time owing to the weather conditions at Dulles, but Lufthansa and German Air Traffic Control managed our flight to land on time. Seat comfort was nice with plenty of space left for my knees. Nonetheless, my seat was broken and therefore it reclined all the time which was awkward for the person sitting right behind me. Flight crew was outstanding. They did their job always with an extra smile and I told one flight attendant about my damaged seat and he dealt with the situation and offered me a new seat, which was fantastic. Food was okay, which was also down to me as I am not fond of Camembert cheese. Drinks were available all the time in the galleys and also offered by the crew throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment offered plenty of films in several languages which was a nice touch as well. The only thing bad about this flight was a rude female passenger next to me complaining about me going to the loo twice at this 8 hour lasting flight, but that is not Lufthansa's fault at all! I highly recommend flying with Lufthansa owing to its high standards in terms of security, service and reliability on the whole.",Promoter
"Flew from Los Angeles to Sydney October 23rd. Flight attendants could not possibly be less interested in service if they tried. Not one flight attendant offered to help with bedding or even inquire if I needed anything. Food service was dreadful. The flight attendant practically dropped the breakfast tray in my lap when she got around to serving it. The breakfast was nothing to write home about and what is it with serving the utensils from the freezer? I was so looking forward to flyng Qantas because I had heard good things about the service. Sadly my experience would hardly fit in that category. The return trip from Sydney to Los Angeles on November 12th offered friendlier flight attendants and better service but not enough to make up for the my very poor first impression. This flight departed Sydney around noon and ""lunch"" was not served until about 4pm Sydney time. What took so long?

Flights from ORY-MAD-BOS May 6 2013. Pre-flight was problematic: I was unable to check in on-line so I had to call Iberia to get seats. When I checked in at airport seat assignments I had obtained on the phone about 12 hours earlier were ignored. The flights themselves were fine. Food was typical airline food and there was no personal entertainment system on MAD-BOS flight.

"  On Tuesday, April 4th 2017, I flew back home with American Airlines to Dallas Fort Worth Airport. My flight was scheduled to depart at 5.50 pm. At around 5.30, when it was time to board, they announced that the flight would be delayed because the First Officer was in Washington D.C. and his flight had not yet departed for LGA. Flight was delayed a half hour, later they came back saying that the plane had still not departed and it probably wouldn't be until much later. At around 7.00 pm, the pilot announced that the First Officer's flight had barely taken off and hopefully we could depart by 8 pm. We finally began boarding at around 7.30 pm and did not depart until almost 8.30 pm. I was supposed to land in DFW at 8.45 pm and did not land until past 11.00 pm. I reached out to AA hoping they could somehow fix this situation since it was not mechanical, operational or due to weather and the most I got was an apology. Unfortunately AA has been declining in punctuality and Customer service. It is no as longer reliable as it used to be. Very disappointing.",Detractor

The flight itself followed the familiar format of a KLM European flight, sandwich and drinks served by as always friendly crew in a well presented 737 cabin.

Good selection of movies to watch on the seat back tvs though the screen size is on the small size. Food was rather poor but come to expect that, beer and wine is free on international flights and there were frequent runs for water, tea and coffee and a nice touch that ice cream was offered mid flight, and just before landing they give you a cold snack. Flight attendants worked well during the flight and kept the passengers well fed and watered. All flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations early, the IAD-LHR arrived 50 mins early being a 6.20am arrival meant an easy exit through border control, getting luggage and exiting the airport in 20 mins.

" Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious.

"  At Milan Linate they always put you on a bus to the aircraft which therefore defeats any priority boarding advantage since everybody is lumped together. Once the doors of the bus open it is survival of the fittest with a stampede of people to the stairs of the aircraft to see who can get on-board first. Once onboard, the stewardess insisted I put my carry-on on a different overhead locker since the one directly above my seat was partly in business class which was only had 2/3 of the seats occupied (middle seat deliberately not used) - never encountered such an issue before in 20 plus years of flying. Other people also having to deal with the ""difficult"" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins. This resulted in the captain actually coming out to speak to the Alitalia staff to tell them to hurry up with completing the boarding. Once seated, very little legroom.

" Conclusion: avoid Aer Lingus if you are traveling as a family. They do not respect the value of family and no one is willing to take any responsibility after our horrible experience with them. What happened: We booked a returned flight from/to Toronto to Frankfurt. We were traveling with our 9 month old baby. Right after we booked and paid the tickets, we called the agent to request a baby bassinet and priority seats both ways immediately. We flew from Toronto to Frankfurt with bassinet, no problem. But the agent said we need to make another call before our return flight to reserve the bassinet. 48 hours before our return flight on April 1st, we called the Aer Lingus office in Germany where we would board the flight. They told us they have no access to the seating system and asked us to go to the airport counter for requesting the bassinet. We arrived three and a half hours before the scheduled flight time to check in and to request the bassinet (We were the second in line after the counter was opened). The person on the counter told us, she has no access to the flight from Dublin to Toronto, which is the long flight after our first short flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. She asked us to request the bassinet seat when we transferred at Dublin airport. I asked her, there will only be less than 2 hours transfer time, wouldn't the seats all be taken? What if we do not get a bassinet seat? She said she cannot help and we can only go and find out there. We arrived at Dublin airport, when we went to check in for the second flight, which is going to be 7 and half hours long from Dublin to Toronto. The lady at the counter said there is no bassinet seats anymore and she cannot help us. She told us rudely that there is nothing she can do and we can only go board the plane and ask the cabin crew for the seat change. We boarded the plane EI129, and of course it is full and there was no single crew member who was willing or able to help us at all. We were sitting in the middle seats. Carrying a 9 month old baby at hand. No extra seats or spaces were beside us. And all the crew members were very unfriendly to us. One of them told us it was because there was a last minute cabin change so two families with babies could not get the bassinet seats including us. They even told us: sorry this happened every week I saw many families always left without their requested prioirity seats in the end especially for Sunday and Monday flight. During the whole 7 and a half flight, we did not feel well at all. No one helped us, no one cared about us. Even when my husband was standing beside the hallway to rock the baby and tried to let her sleep because our seats were so tight and small she couldn't nap, one of the crew member came to us and said we cannot stand there. (The seat belt sign was not on at the moment). The baby was crying nonstop because she was so tired but kept getting disturbed by these actions. We asked to speak to the cabin manager three times, and throughout the whole flight not once he came to communicate with us. We felt deeply sad about the unfortunate experience. We contacted Aer Lingus customer service and no one is willing to take responsibility and respond to us.",Detractor

" Bali to Gatwick via Hong Kong. This airline has to be the worst airline I have ever been on. The cabin crew spoilt the journey for me and my partner. They were rude, miserable and uninterested. You did not see any crew apart from when it was meal time which was so disorganised. If you wanted another drink apart from your meal one you had to get up and walk to the back where all of them were standing around chatting and laughing to ask them for one but only a small amount of water was offered. I tried to be helpful with our dinner trays and was told not to do it again as it was not helpful! When I was putting my hand luggage up in the locker a stewardess barged past me making me fall into the seats. The list goes on and on. I think it says something about the airlines attitude to their passengers, that only first class and premier fliers are welcomed onto the plane in your PA announcements. I would guess that economy passengers make far more income for the airline as a whole and maybe you should consider treating them with a little more respect.",Detractor

"  We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Promoter
Considering our outbound flight to Orlando was delayed a good 2 hours I'm not sure why I expected better service from BA coming home. Over a day before our return flight was due there was already a delay posted bumping our flight up a whole three hours. The next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening! We booked our flight to leave Saturday so we would arrive home on Sunday and be able to go back to work for the Monday. But thanks to the reliability of British Airways not only had we paid for two - now immensely - overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs! Absolutely disgusting show from BA I honestly wouldn't even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business!

I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air. Incheon is a wonderful airport for with lots of pleasing amenities for extended layovers so I would not hesitate to fly Korean (or Cathay for that matter) for future transpacific flights.,Promoter
Rome to Perth October 17. Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident I will still fly with them though.,Detractor
Recently flew to Casablanca and back. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the flight. In business class the food was delicious fresh and served nicely. Video quality was good as was the selection of films although the headset was not as comfortable as on some other airlines.

"Paris CDG to Dubai with Emirates. The chauffer transfer worked well, the lounge was good and I enjoyed the IFE. That is where the positives end. Check in was slow and did not feel I was warmly greeted. Greeting on the plane was neither warm or genuine compared with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew did not engage and would not make eye contact when walking past. Had to make up my own bed. Food was average and not the best wine selection. Overall, this was not a premium experience.",Detractor
August 16 2013. Supposed to travel to Punta Cana that day from Cincinnati. We were told there was a slight delay and we would depart an hour later. That hour turned into a 20 hour delay reason being said because someone on the returning flight got very sick and the solution (IV bag) was used on that person and they could not fly us back out until the solution was replaced. They had no other plane to put us on and we would fly out the next morning. Yes they gave us a voucher to use at the airport but by that time everyone had already eaten and also the airport stores were closed. They gave us free hotel rooms near the airport and a shuttle service. Needless to say we arrived in Punta Cana a day later and they did reimburse us for a small amount of the daily room charge.,Detractor
"âŒ   Flew to Mallorca for the Mallorca 70.3 Ironman race the week before last. I purchased what I thought to be all Delta flights however Air Europa were the operators for all of the legs of my flight. I brought my racing bike in its travel case complete with all gear - helmet, cycling shoes, and race day necessities (not to mention a very pricey TT bike). Upon arrival to Mallorca Air Europa informed me that my bike was ""lost"" so I filed a claim. It took 15+ phone calls initiated by me, posts on Twitter to actually put some pressure on the airline and 5 days to locate my bike. Upon ""localization,"" they tweeted at me and said the bike would arrive in Palma at 3:10PM that day. I called and confirmed the flight and nearly five hours after the flight landed and no bike, I called Air Europa who informed me that the bike was being held in Madrid and being sent back to JFK since I was leaving Mallorca on May 16. However, I was leaving Mallorca on May 19 on their same airline (information that was right in front of their faces). I have never experienced sure bad communication, poor customer service and a generally bad business acumen in my entire life - and I've traveled to four continents on numerous airlines without issue. I suggest to never fly Air Europa if you value your possessions and your time.",Detractor
Flew HKG-EWR. The business class was booked solid. The service was cursory at best. The dinner and breakfast (if you wanted to call it that) was an embarrassment to CX.

" Seattle from San Francisco. Although there was no lounge available (Los Angeles has a lounge), the flight was better than the previous one. First Class gave us priority check-in, priority security check, priority boarding and they all saved time and came in useful. The seats were comfortable and this time, the flight attendants were extremely nice, friendly and approachable. Service was just excellent. They served food for the short 2h flight and it was delicious. Of course, a negative point of first class was the IFE being in the armrest which was inconvenient. However, the IFE was easy to use and very responsive. It also had sufficient content. Virgin America provides free messaging services and it worked well on my WhatsApp as I was able to stay in contact with my friends although it was a little slow.",Passive
"  Spirit Airlines baggage prices are a 'rip off' compared to other American or Canadian airlines. They charge excessive amounts, allow less weight and even charge for carry on luggage that others allow for free.

"  Frontier Airlines is, in every applicable way, the very worst of what an already shaky industry has to offer. They manage to get it pitifully wrong both before and during flights. First, don't be fooled by Frontier's flights landing among the cheapest offered by aggregators such as KAYAK. These prices fail to take into account costs such as $45 for a single checked bag and no complementary food or beverage offerings except water. So overall, the value of a Frontier ticket is at the very bottom -- and that's with all else about the experience assumed to be equal. But in fact, their customer service is even worse than their duplicitous pricing. On a recent flight from Denver to Providence, the desk clerk gave me a receipt but no boarding pass, which I failed to notice because they look similar. As I result I was turned back at security. This might have been forgivable had the agent I dealt with back at check-in - a different employer than the one who had screwed up earlier - not been unaccountably scornful, as if I'd been the one who's screwed up. Given that I was close to missing my flight, I certainly didn't need the added stress of this person's contempt. On my return flight two weeks later, I experienced some sudden GI distress about halfway through the four-hour ride, so I got up to use the lavatory. As I approached the back of the plane, one of the flight attendants snapped, ""Sir, the fasten seat belts sign is lit."" As I gestured and started to plead my case, the flight attendant repeated herself, droid-like in her monotonic replies. I went back to my seat, but in all honesty I almost wish I'd had an ""accident"" right there in the aisle so that this cheerless automaton would have had to clean it up. (Soon afterward, the same flight attendant was very enthusiastic about trying to hector me into applying for a credit card.) There is also no Internet service, not even for the usual exorbitant rates. Did I mention that my previous experience with Frontier was almost as bad? Stay away from this outfit. Even when I despise something I'm generally too lazy to note my disappointment online, reserving my rare reviews for strong praise. But in this case, having discerned that this company's business model resembles that of low-end, worthless cellular carriers, I feel compelled to warn off as many travellers as possible. Frontier deserves to fail.",Detractor
"I have always travelled BA and have recently been upgraded to bronze which I would have thought had a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part! Time to look at a new airline to fly with.",Detractor
"  Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Extremely appalling service by the callous staff at Manchester. I am a frequent flyer and travelled all the continents. This time I was carrying my usual hand luggage and they did not allow me to carry it as its small wheels were not fitting in the frame. Whilst I stated that I have been using this in many flights none had any objection they did not budge. We are different was their response. Then to add insult to injury asked me to pay Â£160.0 as it was the airline fee for additional bag. As my first check in bag hardly had 16kg, I was told to transfer stuff in it and throw the hand bag away. When I tried to transfer stuff in checked in hand bad it became 24.0kg and they would not even allow for that. I have been trying to contact their UK office and spoke to them three times regarding my luggage issue.

LIS-AMS on Jan 20 on an Airbus 320 in Business - straight forward morning point to point flight as part of an intercontinental itinerary. Flight was on time (and this is where the good things end) and Business Class was almost empty - Premium Check in at LIS with no lines but refused to check our luggage through to VIE on OS (both airlines are part of Star Alliance) as â€œthey are not allowed to do this unless the connection is on TAP. Although we used two separate tickets this was never an issue before with other major airlines. I guess the agent just did not want to deal with it. As we had a longer layover in AMS it was not a real problem but inconvenient. Boarding was bizarre and the procedure just plain stupid. At first the flight was called for boarding 30 minutes before departure and people are asked to line up starting with pre-boarding for small children and the physically challenged. They were first in line. Then one gate agent goes through the line and tells everybody to stand in one of three new lines (based on class of service and seat number) once this is finished the gate agent starts to board line by line. However you are not allowed to actually board the plane but you have to stand in a new line at the gangway for further 10 minutes before the actual boarding of the plane commences. Basically everybody including families with small children and business class passengers had to stand in three different lines for 30 minutes before they were allowed to board the plane. Never seen such an atrocious boarding procedure before. Once on board service was very lacklustre and limited to the initial meal service and tax free sales. Other than that the female FA was in hiding mode behind the curtain. You could actually see her skipping through various magazines totally unconcerned with serving passengers. Also breakfast was a small plate of cold cuts and sub-par for an almost three hour business class flight. All in all a very disappointing flight especially as previous experiences with TP in Economy have been quite good. TP lounge is Lisbon is nice with good quality offerings both drink- and food wise but tends to get packed during busy times. I could not say that any aspect of the flight was in line with one expects from business class. No drama as TP got us to our destination on time but clearly not recommended as the experience was somewhere between mediocre (on board) and unpleasant (check-in and boarding) Definitely not good enough for business class prices.

Fifteen minutes before the flight my Dad received an email saying the flight was delayed until 2.30. I was annoyed but ok about the 2 hour wait. Then he received another email saying that the flight had been delayed until 9.15, this is unnacceptable as this was a 9 hour wait and we had different things booked in Las Vegas for my family to attend.

"  Worst experience ever with Air India! I traveled alone with my 9 month old son from Frankfurt to Delhi and onto Sydney! It's a very long and exhausting flight and I think everybody knows with a baby it's even harder! The first problems started when they weren't be able to print the boarding pass for my son. They kept me 2 hours in front of the check-in that I couldn't care properly for my son. Just waiting. Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying. They didn't care. I got more and more stressed. At the end they wrote a manual boarding pass and I had to run again to the boarding to get my 12 hours flight. Terrible!",Detractor
BHX-CDG-PTY A318 out of Birmingham was good fun seats a little narrow but decent pitch crew pretty miserable juice and a croissant for an hour flight not bad. CDG is a pretty poor airport in comparison with other European hubs. Flight to PTY departed from terminal 2E. 777-200 was quite old but well maintained. 3x4x3 seating does make your seat very narrow but pitch wasn't too bad. Worst thing was the IFE like something from the late 90's choice was minimal and screen quality awful. Food and service was good (champagne cognac and ice cream all offered) but crew quickly vanished once the first meal was served although the self service trolley's are a great idea and encourages you to get up and stretch your legs.,Passive
Me and my wife went from Milan (Bergamo - Orio al Serio) to Prague for a week last August taking 2-way tickets with Wizzair. First problem: It is not true that you can add other baggage online once you've booked online and paid for your baggage. What they declare on their website is false. We had 1 booked suitcase going to Prague and we needed to carry 2 booked suitcases to come back. We had to pay an extra 65 Euros at the airport to add 1 booked suitcase. Second problem: going to Prague the dimensions of my cabin suitcase were ok. Coming back they did not conform to the standard anymore (2 cm. higher). Will never fly Wizzair again.,Detractor
SAS-CPH-LHR. SK503. Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call. So now all normal pre-flight checks and documentation before security (including passport verification) can be done without staff contact and hopefully without queuing. Flight was good tea and coffee free landed nearly on time with quick baggage delivery.,Promoter
" Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",Promoter
Flew between Toronto and Samana Dominican Republic - Feb 7-14/15. Yes the seats are extremely cramped and the armrest between my partner and I wouldn't stay up (to allow us a bit of extra room).

" Auckland to Los Angeles. I have three issues with this operation. First of all, in the departure lounge, they had two gates line up in a queue that had to be 100 meters long, and at no time was anyone in the queue fully confidant that they were in the correct one, also no one was advising us as to what was going on. Secondly, they went and changed our already selected seat assignments which were two aisle seats to an aisle and a center seat. Thirdly, these seats are by far the most uncomfortable seats on any aircraft that I've flown for more than an hour. The seats are so tight that it's a joke, also the leg room is almost non-existent. The seating on Ryanair that I flew a while back was vastly superior. In addition to the above, I was totally unable to eat the meal they provided as the seat back of the person in front of you restricts access to it, that was probably a blessing for me as the meal looked as though it would not be good for you. Would certainly not recommend sitting on this airline to anyone, unless it was an emergency.",Detractor
" Luton to Athens. I have flown with them a number of times now and, although you are prepared for a bit of discomfort and hassle when you book with a budget airline, you can normally adjust this to your needs with an upgrade or purchase of extras that they all offer. In this case it was their priority package so that i could take an extra piece of luggage. The problem with this is that you may get priority check in to the departure lounge (i.e. before the rest of the passengers) but not the plane, for which there is an absolute free for all, including fights for luggage space. More worrying, on the check in'at Athens airport no id checks were made at all! So either be prepared for basic or go elsewhere, because you will not get what you pay for.

" My family of 4 was due to fly on Norwegian on Sunday 5 August from Chania to Gatwick. Whilst waiting to board we were told that a crew member had exceeded maximum flying hours and the flight would be delayed â€“ later amended to cancellation. Some people received this news by email. The plane took off empty for its return flight. One member of airport staff tried to find information and eventually said that accommodation would be found for one night, but that passengers had to find their own alternative flights back. The Norwegian alternatives online were a 12hr+ flight on Monday via Stockholm, an overnight stop in Oslo on the Tuesday, or the next direct flight would be Thursday 9th. Everyone was trying to access the internet and any alternative flights were quickly fully booked. There was no assistance for those who did not have internet access. Anyone wanting to wait for the Thursday direct flight was told they would not get accommodation refunded. No transfers would be paid for either. Eventually we managed to book a BA flight from Heraklion on Monday 6th at our own expense. We were fortunately allowed to go back to our hotel for 1 night, and additionally incurred taxi fares for the 3 hour trip to Heraklion, plus meals. Our travel insurers told us that the claim should be first through the Airline, and the holiday company we booked through (Love Holidays) say the same. We have claimed the Â£1250+ spent, but having signed up to a Facebook Group â€œNorwegian Airlines Experiences from Hellâ€, discover that over 1800 people have or have had issues with this airline, and we are fearful of not receiving either our expenses or compensation/refunds. Another passenger from our flight has already had his claim refused due to ""staff sickness being an exceptional circumstance"" (which it is not). The worst part is not knowing in this situation what you should do. We were fortunate that we could put alternative flights on credit card, but they still have to be paid for, and we feel totally abandoned. We know that we are entitled to refunds and compensation, but do not have any confidence that we will get them.

I've flown American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and have never had a flight cancelled in my life. Flew twice with United (once in July, once in August) and both times they've been cancelled. And it's impossible to get anyone on the phone. Safe to say I will be avoiding United for the rest of my life. Two absolutely terrible experiences.",Detractor
"  My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. Poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.",Passive
Rome (FCO) to Athens - July 2013. We flew Easy Jet from Rome to Athens and found the overall experience pretty good. The crew were pleasant enough and professional. The airplane while a little dated worked fine with adequate leg room (economy). I believe a small snack was provided for this rather short flight. No on board entertainment again due to it being a short flight. Flight was on time and progressed without any issues. We would fly with Easy Jet again!,Promoter
"I've flown Ethiopian within Africa on routes between several cities in Africa and flights have been pleasant. New fleet, cheerful and helpful flight attendants. This is a complete contrast to their flights into and out of the continent. Planes were very old with no inflight entertainment whatsoever. I could never get over the fact that the flight attendants are rude and unwilling to help. I'm not talking about them not smiling (I understand some cultures don't really smile). When several fellow passengers were asking for water or drinks they were ignored. One passenger was trying to call one of them, and he was ignored. When I asked if the flight was full and if it was possible for me to change seats (I was seated next to a very obnoxious passenger), the flight attendant just said ""if you can find an empty seat go ahead."" Besides that, it takes them way too long to serve food and get the food trays after eating. Some passengers put their trays on the floor creating a mess and it took them too long to clean it, even though they could clearly see the mess those passengers were making. And there are only three toilets in the economy class for almost 200 people. There was a queue to the lavatories the whole time. I booked my flight because they offered the fastest route to my destinations in Africa, but I've discovered it's not worth it. They're not even that much cheaper compared to other airlines! How this airline became a part of the Star Alliance is one of life's greatest mysteries.",Detractor
 Great Christmas holiday in Spain starting with a visit to Air Canada's new Signature Suite. Very personal attentive service and the food was great. The flights to and from Madrid were good. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. The A330 has the classic business class pods. The seat was uncomfortable even in bed mode and lacked storage places for personal electronics. The overall experience with Air Canada was good and I would fly with them again.,Promoter
" Gothenburg to London. Flights were on time. Staff were friendly. However, a new trick as usual has been introduced by Ryanair. They reduced the size of the cabin luggage to less than what's generally approved by other airlines! Also the left armrest has been broken and removed!",Detractor
"  Ft Lauderdale to Kansas City via Detroit. I flew down to South Florida to help my elderly parents whom both are disabled. Hurricane Irma took out the AC unit, 1/4 of the roof, and we had no power or internet for at least 8 days. I was supposed to stay there for only 6 days I ended up staying 14, they waived the fees for my flight changes Thanks Again Spirit Airlines.",Promoter
"After 3 hours in the plane waiting for repairs the hostess announced that we needed to disembark, we wait another 3 hours at the gate without any clear info on what was happening. People started getting upset and complained and in exchange they got a 8 Euro coupon for a drink, many others did not realize this and did not get anything. Then they made an announcement saying that the flight was canceled and told us to go to the main departure check-in desk, in broken English that not very clear. They did not say which desk, whether or not we had to claim the luggage. At 8pm eventually we reach the departure gate, we were rerouted, got a poor motel and a 16 euro coupon for dinner, a total disaster. Got the luggage 36 hours later.",Detractor
ARN-LHR on an ageing but generally clean B737-600. Seat space is sufficient and boarding/departure was all handled on time and well. The ARN terminal is very nice and spacious. Service onboard is minimal. BOB is exorbitant and the quality is just awful. After purchasing BOB I wasn't offered the complimentary tea/coffee. Early arrival into LHR was a pleasant surprise. If it wasn't for the very affordable price SAS wouldn't be an option in the future.,Detractor
My mother left on AI 43 MAA-DEL connecting AI 101 DEL-JFK on May 2 2014. Flight was slightly delayed from Chennai. She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!,Promoter
 We had the most amazing flight crew on the way home from Milan to Newark. They were just lovely. Seats were very comfortable considering I have very long legs. Best experience flying ever!,Promoter
