"Melbourne to Singapore on a Singapore Airlines refitted B777-300. Check in MEL was slow, and airport security and immigration a mess. MEL can take credit for having some of the most rude airport staff. Comfortable seating onboard, Kudos to Singapore Airlines for keeping 3x3x3 economy class seating. IFE not best and of the older generation - not responsive and bad screen quality. The crew were outstanding and hard working. Generous servings of drinks including Singapore Slings. Sadly their food has taken a very bad turn south. Tiny mains and very uninspired. Food nothing in line with the elaborate and glossy menus handed out. Flight left on time but was late into SIN due to strong head wings. Good flight but several areas have slipped. Highlight on this flight was exceptional crew.",Promoter
" Palermo to Moscow via Rome and I was so unlucky that I left my laptop on board of the aircraft on our way to Moscow. When I realized that the laptop was left, I called to the support service in Russia and asked what should I do. I was told to send a request to the Alitalia lost and found office. The only e-mail address on the website was Italian , and after sending the request I was answered, that this Office has only responsibility for the things left on board of the airplanes going to Rome and was advised to contact Sheremetyevo airport. Sheremetyevo airport explained that they do not collect things from other Airlines, except Aeroflot. Things that are left on board of Alitalia Airlines are brought to the small Alitalia Office located at Sheremetyevo. After asking Alitalia main Office for the contact, I got the answer that they dont have it. So the only way to find something you left on board going to Moscow is to come every day to Sheremetyevo Alitalia Office and ask them personally. No e mail address, No telephone number, No permanent working hours. Basically you have to live in Sheremetyevo and wait if the lady in a green Alitalia T shirt will get returned your laptop. How come that the national airline company of Italy do not have the local number of their own representative in Russia and cannot answer the simple question who gets the forgotten on board luggage if it is found? I can surely say that it a clear sign of unrespectful attitude to the customers and was really choked of the unwilling of the Alitalia employees to help, they were just redirecting every time from call centre in Russia back to lost and found Office in Rome. Really poor quality service!",Detractor
Actual flight both ways was good but the handling at Stansted and Rhodes wasn't. We felt like cattle not customers. Stansted we were held up getting to airport we had priority booking but had to wait with everyone else as priority queue had gone therefore one of the cabin bags had to go in the hold. At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage. The overhead luggage compartments were half empty. It just seems like another Ryanair useless rule.,Passive
  Flew Spirit Airlines from Orlando to Boston. My big gripe with this airline is the cost for luggage. A bag that normally is considered a carry-on cost me $50 and my suitcase also cost $50 when JetBlue only charges me $25 and the carry-on is free. $100 dollars for a suitcase and normally a carry-on? Are you kidding me? Its partially my own fault for not flying JetBlue both directions. Next time I use kayak or another website I'll make sure Spirit is never an option for my travels. Completely unacceptable.,Detractor
" Shockingly poor experience on many levels, as AA had no regard for customer service. As a Oneworld Emerald am entitled to a range of benefits on AA including priority seating for myself and family. My daughter was traveling with me on this occasion, albeit on a paid ticket on separate record. AA flat out refused to link our records so my daughter could sit with me in Main Cabin Extra, necessitating me to downgrade to sit with my daughter. We were guilty of buying two paid tickets on different records and no fewer than six AA phone and airport personnel were unable to resolve and change. Instead MCE seats were given to non status customers for free at JFK check in. I am extremely loyal and fly 50+ AA, 100 Oneworld flights per year and simply cannot understand the lack of empathy or empowerment of employees in situations like this. Economy was extremely the usual uncomfortable cattle car. Deboarding devolved into a shouting match and pushing contest as several passengers rushed the door, with no AA personnel around to supervise what should be simple. Would not recommend.",Detractor
" Athens to Cairo. There is nothing special about this flight. However, I was surprised about the meal service. The food was delicious and well portioned, particularly for a 2-hour flight. In fact, it tasted better than some business class meal I had on long-haul flights. The equipment, a Boeing 737-800, was new and clean.",Promoter
 Toronto to Sofia via Frankfurt. Lufthansa is now selling Economy light more or less it was the same price for me through a third party travel site on trans-Atlantic flights but with no checked bags. You could end up paying $200 or more on top of your ticket.,Detractor
"Another flight with easyJet last week coincided with their 20th birthday, so flight crews were in a celebratory mood. My wife and I also received an e-mail telling us that we first flew with easyJet in 2005 and have travelled over 120,000 kms with them since then. Apart from one significant delay in Corfu because of weather, we have never had any problems with any of our flights. The existence of easyJet (and to a lesser extent, Ryanair) has allowed us to travel frequently and cheaply, which would have been impossible 20 years ago, so thank you for that, easyJet. Yes, one can be picky and identify minor irritations at times, e.g. on this latest flight to Malaga we were marginally late leaving Liverpool because boarding was delayed despite this being the plane's first flight of the day. Such gripes are trivial, however, in comparison with the efficient and good-humoured service provided by all the easyJet staff we have encountered over the years. The slightly tardy departure apart, this flight more than lived up to the usual standard, with a bonus of an anniversary token for everyone on board.",Promoter
"  Flew Rome to London Gatwick. Big disappointment, I paid Â£180 to fly with British Airways just for one way and the plane was delayed two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft. Instead of arriving at 21.30 we landed almost at midnight. No refreshments were offered, nothing. The customs queue was massive, I got home at 3.00 in the morning. I decided to pay extra for BA instead of flying Ryanair and it was a huge mistake. Even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work. BA is not worth the extra money. Staff did not speak a word of Italian.",Detractor
  Flew Air Canada rouge from Liberia to Manchester via Toronto. Absolute disgrace of an airline. Had to wait for over four hours for drinks service on outgoing flight. No TVs as they want you to rent their iPads with horrendous viewing options. Flight delayed by four hours on return. Only told we could get food vouchers 30 mins before we boarded - again it's all about the money. We had no food on a flight of over 5 hours. We checked with staff in Toronto that we didn't need to collect our bags for our connection which they confirmed. Lo and behold our bags didn't arrive as we'd been told. Avoid these utter clowns at all costs.,Detractor
"Thankfully this flight was much better than the other reviews had us believe. It was a 3 hour flight to Lisbon from Frankfurt. The staff at check in and onboard were very friendly and full of life. The food and drinks were served efficiently. Very tasty too but we skipped the octopus! Our seats in row1 on the 319 plane were comfortable but we weren't looking to sleep. The incline isn't very much. We had our own movies on IPads as there was no other ""entertainment"". It was an enjoyable flight.",Promoter
Toronto to Liberia Costa Rica on Jan 22nd flight #724 returned on Feb 6th flight #725. Considering that their prices are amongst the highest nothing special and I purchased a promotion buy one get half off second still cost us just over $800 each. They can keep their champagne (one way only) and the awful food they serve and lower the cost. Paid more for the extra legroom I don't know how anyone could sit comfortably in the regular seats. Flew American last year with a layover in Miami and would definitely consider again. Lovely updated aircraft roomy seats no meals but price was over $150 less. Only reason I booked direct was I was travelling with my 90 year old mother the layover would have been too much for her. Flight attendants were very nice check in staff was great in Toronto and Liberia.,Passive
"  Casablanca to Chicago via Montreal. My family and I was went on vacation to Morocco from Chicago. For some reason they weren't able to book my flight completely with theirs and I had all routes with the 6 of them except for going home from Montreal back to Chicago I had a layover of about 8 hours. After being in Morocco for 9 days on the road and falling sick, I was wanting to get home with my family. We requested them to allow that to happen. I could not afford the 150 dollars change fee and they saw my family board a plane with empty seats available but refuse to put me on it even though the baggage could have been transferred over. Then there was another flight 4 hours later that they didn't want to put me on either and said you chose to buy this ticket.",Detractor
Can't complain about the staff and the service provided by them my problem is the delay that affected my trip.

"  Penang to Shanghai via Hong Kong. PEN to HKG route uses an older A320 while HKG to Shanghai uses a newer Airbus.

" Chisinau to Bucharest in Business class. In Chisinau we had a designated mini-bus to the plane. The boarding was fast and efficient. The plane is a 19 year old ATR 42-500 with a decently kept cabin in 2-2 configuration for both classes. No wifi, multimedia, touch screens, power outlets. Seats covered in a grey leather looking material, were comfortable with great leg-room in business. Offered great food in business - a significant upgrade in quality and menu since my last short haul flight with them. We had muffins, fresh and dried fruits, cheese, bread, butter and jam. Great selection with soft drinks (and some alcohol as well, but it's not the best decision for a morning flight). Cabin service was outstanding. Everything was just impeccable.",Promoter
" Columbus to Orlando. Worst airline ever. They don't know the meaning of customer service. Flight was originally delayed 2 hours, then cancelled at the last min. I had a check in representative act like I was responsible for the flight being cancelled when I inquired about re-booking. I was given the run around for 2 hours. I finally got information on how to book with another carrier, only to have that flight cancelled. This is not how I wanted my first day of vacation to begin.",Detractor
21/6/14 EK354 DXB-SIN. Boarding not by zones this time and some confusion occurred at the gate. Middle aged aircraft by EK's standards 4.4 years old well maintained interior but my seat pocket had a bit of uncleared rubbish. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her. As usual EK is really good if you get a good crew. Only disappointment this flight was the food.,Promoter

" Brisbane to London via Abu Dhabi. Check in staff were OK but there were no proper instructions at the tome of boarding. On board, it seem, the flight crew do not have fine training. There is no menu card and staff did not know what food there were serving. When serving, he asked me if I wanted Chicken or Lamb, so I asked what is the dish and he said in broken English that ""it is like Chicken Pasta & Spicy Lamb"" So my wife & I ordered one each. What we got was tasted like Thai Green Chicken curry with Rice Noodles & Lamb Biriyani. After a 14 Hour flight, 2 hours before landing in Brisbane at 6pm, they started to serve a snack! When asked what it was, he said ""Vegetarian"" & I got a Chocolate Danish Pastry with Custard! The tray was left on our tables until 30 mins before we landed - the whole service was a mess. If I had a choice, I would prefer not to travel with Etihad but if the price is very cheap, I may be forced to put up with the rubbish or take my own food.",Detractor
LIS-MAD-VIE on Sept 21 both legs in Business Class on an Airbus 320 and Airbus 321 respectively. Both legs were on time or almost on time. Slight delay into VIE not an issue. Transfer at MAD T4 hassle free although involved long walks due to size of terminal. No extra transfer security checks for intra-EU transfers. IBs Business lounge was excellent in all respects (comfort drinks food available space etc.). Only slight discomfort was that the WLAN vouchers handed out are restricted to 30 minutes so that multiple vouchers and log-in were required. Seats in Business Class were economy seats with their middle seats empty. IB uses the same Recaro slim line seats that Star Alliance does for European flights which are not the most comfortable option but were ok due to better than average leg room. In flight service on both legs was excellent with friendly and attentive FAs. Food served was a plain but tasty omelet with vegetables on the morning flight from LIS to MAD and a very good veal burger with potatoes (or a pasta dish) with a nice mixed salad on the second leg. Check in and security procedures in LIS were hassle free and a lot faster than expected after what at first glance looked like a bit of chaos with tons of people waiting and moving when entering the terminal early morning. But everything was handled quite well. IB uses the shared Blue Lounge is LIS which was just OK. (TP's premium lounge is far superior.) In VIE it took quite some time for the luggage to arrive but that's not IB fault and pretty much standard in VIE. First time I chose IB for the LIS-VIE route,Promoter
XIY-ICN-CDG last week. The first leg was onboard a 13-year old A333. Flight was on-time food was acceptable and service impeccable. The second leg was on a new A380. Unfortunately the check-in systems do not work for people from outside Korea and hence I got an aisle seat. This was disappointing as 99% of the time I sit by a window. It was interesting to note that the past month the flight had been 40-60 min delayed every day from ICN while arriving on time at CDG most of the time. The same happened to us and I learned that was because of heavy congestion at the airport. This should be fixed if you ask me. The flight itself was very smooth food was great and enough to drink. I'm surprised that they are a bit cheap on drinks not giving a can of soft drink but just a glass. Makes you feel less worth in many ways. Smooth landing at CDG was nice.,Promoter
" London to Manila via Kuwait was possibly one of the best flights we have taken. The plane was quite new, the staff absolutely fabulous, service first class. The legroom adequate, the inflight entertainment excellent. Kuwait airport has a lovely bunch of duty free shops. The fact that it's an alcohol free flight was quite refreshing actually, no staying up drinking, everyone relaxed. I do drink alcohol, and it was lovely not to on this occasion). We were given blankets, pillows and all done with such professional smiling charm. I would recommend this airline highly.",Promoter

Here again the aircraft is showing its age. Our preferred seat 12 A and C has no window. Service was excellent. The flight attendants were older and were very professional. We learned that Air Canada Rouge is taking over this route in Mid Nov. and we will be returning on that flight in Dec. Our flight departed late however arrived in good time.

6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews'attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.,Passive
HKG to BKK economy good seat at front of cabin TV AVOD old and a bit limited but fine for a short flight. Great service on both flights. Food and drinks fast wine and coffee plentiful. Crew always reply with a smile and a good attitude. I had more legroom than the premium crowd in front of me. Lounge in BKK - considering the high number of flights the lounge is really basic. The priority pass one is much better small crowded limited food and drinks. They also allow other airlines like Sri Lankan to use it too. They really need a decent lounge there to cope with the many flights to HK.,Promoter
"I flew with Air Europa from Madrid to Caracas on January 15th. First of all the flight took off from Madrid off 2 hours. I had purchased a seat with extra leg room at the back of the plane, row 40. It was quite a comfortable seat in that it reclined quite a lot, however I hadn't counted on the extremely badly behaved children screaming at each other and constantly running up and down the aisles. I mentioned this to the air hostesses, but no action was taken. There were no entertainment screens at all in the plane (really the dark ages) and if you wanted in flight entertainment, you had to fork out 10 Euros to obtain an I pad - something I did not do, on principle.The food was appalling. It was a 9 hour flight and lunch consisted of chopped up pasta and minced meat and the evening meal was pieces of very dry pizza. Of course we landed 2 hours late and the cases took 45 mins to appear. I paid $1,500 for the joy of flying with Air Europa as there is a very limited choice of airlines from which to choose on the Caracas to Madrid route. The price of the tickets goes up every 6 months and the service just gets steadily worse.",Detractor
"I am pleased to say Easyjet performed well for the busy summer season for our flights to and from La Rochelle to visit family. We didn't have bags but did get to the airport very early. Outbound: EZY8995, 14.40 (15.30)-17.05 (17.37), July 28th. Once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. Around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. Boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. We pushed back at 15.00 and left Gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. The cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. The food was quite expensive but still not as bad as Ryanair. We landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. The delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. Inbound: EZY8996, 12.35( 13.25)-12.50 (13.20), August 5th. Once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. We boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. We were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. However it was good to catch up with the delay. All in all the easy jet service was normal and the delays were bearable for the peak summer season. Flights costs Â£95 per person with row 7 seats pre-booked.",Passive
"Osaka to Brussels via Amsterdam with KLM. Kudos to this airline for being so efficient and helpful. The Boeing 787-9 on KL868 was a treat. Nothing can beat the 1-2-1 seating. I was seated in 1K and my wife in 2K. Service was the best that you could imagine. What stunned me was that the lavatories were decorated in the Delft Blue House wallpaper which I think was a wonderful idea. An old B77W on the way back on KL867. However, this flight did not disappoint us because the service was better than on the leg coming in. And what a coincidence. Our chief purser was the same charming gentlemen as one week again.

" Terrible! Take any other airline. I fly anywhere between 8-12 time's per year, and when I fly Air Canada I consistently regret booking my flight with their airline. Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn't started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone â€œwe already collected garbageâ€, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was â€œI'll come back thenâ€ She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with â€œyour garbage?â€ And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada. I have finally learned that flying Air Canada is not worth the frustration, confusion, and disrespect I encounter and will no longer consider flying with Air Canada in the future. I believe that there are much more details and events that Air Canada should be aware of if they are serious about improving their service.",Detractor

A380 Club World HKG-LHR. Overall a very good flight with BA. I had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. I find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The inflight entertainment is excellent I do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them. As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapÃ©s starter sounded perfect they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines. Service from cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient and always calling me by my name wherever they see me in the cabin.,Promoter
"Larnaca to Cairo with Egyptair. Small Embraer 170 plane was probably half full. Good legroom in economy but seat width a bit tight - minimal elbow room for two people especially if you wanted to read or work. Cabin crew were efficient getting the food and drink around but unhelpful with passenger enquiries - e.g. which type of immigration card was required. Limited soft drinks selection. Food was largely worst kind of airline food outside budget airlines - rubbery chicken, some sort of salami concoction, plastic cheese and tasteless breads. In-flight information from cabin and crew almost non-existent. Prompt departure from LCA and arrived on time. But plane stood on tarmac at Cairo for 15 mins until the door was opened as the bus to transport us to the terminal had not arrived - maybe more the fault of the airport authorities than the airline, but no explanation given by the crew which just frustrated people.",Detractor
"Recently traveled United Airlines to PVR from EWR round trip, non-stop going and connected thru IAH on the return. This time I opted to upgrade to Business Class on all three routes. Checking in was a breeze in EWR and security was surprisingly easy this time. Minor note, there is absolutely no reason to ever go to the Presidents club anymore in EWR with the updated food options in Terminal C. I would rather pay for a decent breakfast/lunch/dinner then eat the garbage they offer in the Club for ""free"". The seats were nice, however they allow too much recline for seats given the limited seat pitch. The gentleman in front of me reclined all the way back and I struggled to exit my seat to use the facilities without being very disruptive. Apart from the minor issue with the seats everything else about the flight was more than acceptable. The food was good not great. We were offered a decent breakfast, however the coffee is dreadful and the tea no better. The flight attendants were attentive and very cordial the entire time. Flying back thru to EWR from PVR via IAH was just fine except for the disaster that is IAH security. We nearly missed our connection due to extremely long queues to pass back through security after clearing customs. I have never seen only one line open in IAH when you have multiple flights trying to get through security at the same time. There were multiple people in line with us that missed their connections.",Passive
"We flew Air Europa for the first time to go from Paris to Miami via Madrid. The plane was dirty, flight attendants unfriendly and we had to pay for everything. First flight from Paris to Madrid we have not been offered any food because they only had the time to do the first 10 rows. The plane was 2 hours late and we have never been told why. Regarding the Madrid to Miami we had to pay to have some headphones. I had not seen that in years for a long distance flight. Less than 10 movies were offered which really is poor.",Detractor

"  Harare to Marrakech via Madrid. The flight from Harare to Addis was great. The shock came in Addis when flight ET712 to Madrid was overbooked. Upon checking in at Gate 9 (changed from Gate 1), the Ethiopian Airline officers stood three of us aside, apparently because our visa to Spain and Morocco had to be verified by a senior airline officer. Myself, a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a lady from Equatorial Guinea. During the check-in process, the man from the Congo protested fiercely, and was let in. As the queue died, we (me and the lady from Malabo) went to the boarding desk to get the EA senior to verify our VISA's to facilitate. The Ethiopian Airline officer handling the boarding looked aside and shouted, Boarding closed we will re-route you. The senior officer had not pitched up. No one had spoken to us. Nothing. I couldn't believe it that an airline would cook false stories to manage its own problem of overbooking. Fastforward to 02:00 Addis Time, 3 hours after the initial boarding time, we were still in their office and the lady from Malabo promised to get into another flight on Tuesday May 16th. I refused calmly and with smiles of spite. They tried to get me into ET702 to go to Morocco through Rome and i refused, returning their initial transit VISA lie that if i could not do a 60 minute transit to Morocco through Madrid, then i still could not take option of going through Rome, albeit 48 hours later. Later, another officer assisted by getting me proceed to Morocco by EgyptAir. His reason for my transfer ""flight overbooked"". And at this time I asked to see the Supervisor. The supervisor did not come. As this batch of officer's prepared to go home at 03h00, my AirEgypt flight to Cairo was also boarding. I left Addis without seeing the supervisor or getting the truth. I will not fly Ethiopian Airlines on my way back home.",Detractor

I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.,Detractor
" Orlando to Washington in January 2017 on a Boeing 767-400. Although this flight encountered no major irregularities this was not a first class experience. Check in - even for F - was through automated kiosks only. Short line, but taking longer than necessary through to the need to go through many screens focusing on upselling (e.g. to buy UA miles, even if one is not member of the UA frequent flyer program- thoughtless, unnecessary and irritating). UA did not provide TSA priority access at MCO for First Class passengers, but the overall wait was tolerable, as the line was moving fast in spite of many, many people standing in line. Visited UA Club Lounge, which was very basic and food items offered during lunch time poor especially when compared to lounges operated by non U.S. airlines, soup, salads, some poor looking highly processed cheese cubes and crackers and some veggies with dip",Detractor
"  London to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. As I approached the check in area the check in staff were having a conversation. I waited for them to finish there said conversation before I handed my passport. After a few security questions I was checked in and directed to the fast check security , I did so and was greeted by the most welcoming man with a warm smile (a Heathrow staff member) who checked my boarding pass and wished me a safe flight. After browsing the duty free shops I made my way to gate 10 where the Etihad Airways lounge is located. On entertaining the lounge I met two lovely welcome hosts who asked if my luggage and suit bag would like to be stored. She then offered me the WIFI slip. The first impression of the lounge was dark and small. I passed about 6 staff who were standing there like zombies no more then a smile. I had a walk around before I sat in the ala carte section where I thought I would have a nice lunch. There were pre set menus on the table so I had a look and went for the salmon salad of which I ordered after attracting the attention of one of the staff. I asked for a glass of Chardonnay and some sparkling water and was told I had to help my self from the buffet area. I found that very strange considering I was sat in the restaurant area expecting restaurant service? The salad arrived in super quick time (with no salad only x2 baby potatoes cut into 4 pieces, green beans, 2 cherry tomatoes also cut into 4 pieces and a splash of balsamic dressing) - the salmon was very moist clearly being sat in a steamer until an order came in. After my salad-less salad I fancied a coffee so decided I leave the lounge and head to Costa Coffee as the Etihad coffee machine had seen better days. Boarding was called and like you'd expect everyone marched up to the gate in one go only to be turned away as there zones were not yet called. A warm welcome from the crew as I boarded and found my seat 16A. Business seats are incredible and should be rolled out on all Etihads long haul business class. The flight was fantastic, service standards won back from that I had in the lounge. Only downside they have taken the wash bags away and only offer these on night flights! Explained by the crew member with a nervous smile. Items like toothbrush, socks were available but you had to ask. Cutting back things in the premium cabins never goes down well with crew or the paying passengers who expect it. My connection in Abu Dhabi was very long so enjoyed a bit of quiet time and sleep in the lounge. when I finally boarded my flight to Phuket I slept most of the way. Overall opinion on my experience was a fantastic airline but need touching up on the outstations service style to be more consistent.",Passive

Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate.

They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal.

" Charlotte to San Diego. This was a 5 hour flight and this was an ex US Airways A321. It did have the refurbished interior with new seat covers and carpets and overall a fresh clean cabin. But there were still no plugs, no IFE, just Wi Fi and GoGo movie streaming thru the American app (it actually worked very well, no issues at all and a decent selection of movies). But it makes no sense how they can put power ports on their 18 year old Ex US Air A319s but not a 3 year old Ex US Air A321. Nonetheless the seats were very comfortable with acceptable legroom and service was ok, FAs were average for a US airline, Flight left on time and arrived in San Diego 15 minutes early. Only thing I have to say is other than the red stripe on top of the seats the cabin was very very bland. Literally an all grey interior, grey bulkheads with no logos anywhere, grey and navy blue seats, grey carpet, practically all grey livery. Pretty dismal, also the cost for full Wi-Fi access is obnoxious. I bought a messsaging pass for 2 dollars which claimed it worked on skype but Skype said no internet, I could only use iMessage (no SMS) and I couldn't send pictures which was annoying because when I bought GoGo on US Airways in 2014 I could send and post pictures. AA doesn't like to say these Ex US Airways A321s exist, to know what kind of plane you are on look at the plane type on your reservation when you get your ticket. the Ex US Air A321 will be marked ""321"" the new refurbished one with IFE and plugs is marked ""32B""",Promoter

They kept temp very low, then charged for a blanket. (Pillows are to be had for a charge too) They did adjust the temp after complaint. Drinks are offered with meal (I think for people who ordered a meal), but no one comes around for additional water. They will fill your cup or water bottle when you go and ask.

You pay for your meals on board, which means you're not being soaked when paying for your tickets with everything inclusive. They were also very polite. With airlines constantly gouging the public and going out of their way to make flying as horrible as possible, it's nice to know, that Icelandair still knows how to treat people. At the airport in Reykjavik, there was no hassle. Icelandairs lounge at Reykjavik everything from food to beer and wine was free. Then again, this is not, a North American airline.",Promoter

"I booked Economy Brisbane to Sydney and then Premium Economy from Sydney to Hong Kong on 10 December to try Premium Economy and fly the A380 for the first time but I had also registered for an upgrade to Business (at the cost of 25,000 QFF points) and I was granted this. You made a 20-year QFF veteran very happy. I don't think I will ever be able to go back to Economy for a long haul flight ever again. So much space, I didn't know what to do with it! Being called by my name by pleasant flight attendants, a table cloth, nice tasty food, non-stop drinks, proper head phones, amenities kit with socks and toiletries, back massaging options, the list goes on. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft, really quiet and there was hardly any turbulence. I thought the selection of movies was disappointing - there was a lot to select from, but I had either seen them or wasn't interested in the rest. I should have also caught an earlier Brisbane to Sydney flight (minimum 2 hours not 1 hour 25 minutes). I walked straight onto the connecting bus to the International terminal and it was quick getting through immigration but security was very congested with long lines, so there was no time for any duty free shopping or dawdling to the gate (also don't forget about daylight saving if you are from Queensland). I had to walk quickly and boarding was already occurring when I got to the gate but the Business Class line for the upper level of the aircraft had hardly anyone in it. Once on board, there was a delay in pushing back and the Captain kept everyone informed of what was exactly was going on (this is welcomed instead of being vague). Being one of the first off the plane in Hong Kong was great, but there was a lengthy wait for my bag (probably not the fault of Qantas), where you start to fear that your bag never made the flight, but it eventually appeared on the baggage carousel. I would recommend Business Class on the A380, if you ever get the opportunity or want to pay for it.",Promoter

" Washington to Frankfurt via London. Check-In at Dulles Airport was smooth. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere!

Over the last couple of years I have travelled to China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA. The next time I travel BA will be my last choice. I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum.

It is very obvious that Emirates do not carry enough crew on the A380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. Make sure that you are not at the back!

Our first time flying with Spirit was March 2014. We boarded plane on time but sat waiting for over 1 hour with no explanation from the pilot or flight attendants. One passenger finally fed up made a comment to one of the flight attendants stating that someone should make some kind of announcement as to what was going on. Shortly thereafter the pilot made an announcement that the problem was an oxygen tank in the cockpit. Flight attendants were very rude and chatted amongst themselves most of the time. Our second and last time was the end of April. It should be noted both flights were booked at the same time otherwise we would have gone with another airliner. Flight was to leave at 7.20am but arrived late. Announcement was made that there will be a further delay because apparently the plane had hit a bird and it was to undergo an engine check. Pilots and flight attendants left the plane and 2 hours later it was fixed pilots boarded however no flight attendants were to be found another 1/2 hour passed before the attendants arrived. We finally boarded and made it home. On both flights the attendants could have been more respectful and just polite. Food purchases available could broadened.

The food was acceptable and there were regular drinks offered their English style breakfast was odd to say the least I would opt for the Asian style were I to travel with them again. The service on the flight was friendly and welcoming. The TV on any of the flights didn't work for me either there was no sound or the screen wouldn't stay up or it just wouldn't turn on.

" Flew Alitalia from Palermo to Geneva via Rome. Worst customer experience on an airline yet. All flights were on time and baggage arrived correctly, so it is not about operations. From the first telephone contact, initially to change a flight, to the personnel at check in and inflight service, the welcome to guests is cold and unfriendly. Both ways (to and from Palermo) was obliged to check my carry on bag, despite it being of regulation size, as the flight was supposedly full and overhead bin space needed for other carry on. (Why theirs, not mine? Because I also had a checked bag?). In both cases, I observed plenty of available space in overhead lockers when flights took off. Additionally, boarding badly indicated and several passengers from Rome missed the first bus to the plane. Of four flights, 3 all had buses to distant locations despite this being a national airline. Final detail: no food offered to passengers other than a salty cracker snack, whether first thing at 7 am or at 9 pm. Soft drinks only. Would rather fly a low cost and pay for my drinks.",Detractor
London to Kuala Lumpur via Kuwait in Economy. The baggage allowance at 32kg fairly generous if you need that much. We booked this after reading other reviews on this website and were prepared for a poor experience it lived up to the billing! The first experience on boarding was of a filthy plane chewing gum on the floor and trays dirty from tea/coffee etc - it was obvious the plane had not been cleaned. The planes are old and much of the inflight entertainment either didn't work or was unwatchable (no sound no picture or if you are fortunate neither) - so prepare some entertainment for yourself. I had ordered a dairy-free meal and was on each occasion given either butter/cheese/yogurt and this gave me no confidence in the rest of the meal being dairy-free. The flight crew were not helpful and in one instance when tea/coffee was being served the attendant serving tea said that he would return to me with coffee (and a biscuit). However he forgot and though when reminded he did return minus the biscuit - when I asked for a biscuit he said he'd already given me one! The food was generally budget quality though water/drinks could be more frequently given out. I found the seats uncomfortable. Some would argue that you get what you pay for - we didn't think it was value for money we will not be flying Kuwait Airways again. We feel it is worth paying more to save the 5-6 hour stopover in Kuwait (perhaps 7-8 hours on overall travel time) and getting a better level of service.,Detractor
"LGW to Alicante out on 8th September early flight. I was disappointed that due to BA changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However by booking early I got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines.

The new business class cabin on Vancouver to Hong Kong is a big downgrade. The seats go down under the armrests of the seats in front of you so you lie in a narrow casket-shaped space - your legs can't move up and down at all but the part of the lid over you chest and face is open. When the passengers put their seats back up it literally looks like vampires rising out of caskets. It's very cramped and there's no privacy. The herring bone pods were worth the money to me - you got a smidgen of privacy. The new configuration is back to 2 across (ex for a few singleton seats that are always gone already) so you have someone breathing at you from a foot away that you have to crawl over to get to the aisle. I will look for other airlines where AC uses this cabin.,Detractor
Flew FRA-BKK-MNL on July 12/13. A380 flight out of Frankfurt excellent highly recommend upper deck economy if you can book your seat in advance. Small cabin great attentive service.

"  Flew New York to Melbourne via Los Angles. On both legs the seats were comfortable, IFE was of a very high quality. Cabin crew were always smiling, provided friendly service and responded to the call button promptly. The food was great, at least three choices for dinner (the pasta was especially delicious) and two for breakfast, plus regular snack and drink runs throughout the flight. Even the cabin announcements were provided in a very pleasant manner. I highly recommend Qantas on the transpacific routes.",Promoter
"  Terrible airline. My flight was cancelled 2/7/19, Thursday evening, due to snow. Spirit's idea on getting another flight out was possibly on Saturday they would be able to get me to Las Vegas. I ended up flying out Thursday night with Delta but it cost an additional $400 for a last minute flight. I came back Sunday morning, 2/10/19 and my flight out of Las Vegas was delayed due to the plane coming in. So I missed my connection and the best they could do was to possibly get me home on Monday or Tuesday. I ended up getting an airfare with Sun Country, which cost me $400. It cost me over $800 extra for Spirits poor service and airfare and all they will do is credit me back the cost of Spirits airfare. Note to self-book with any other airline other than Spirit and pay extra $100 up front and know you will get to your destination on time and have a customer service team that cares. Do not fly Spirit - big rip off.",Detractor
"â   Los Angeles to Seattle. Had a horrible experience flying United. I had flown from Cancun (United Airlines again) to LAX and had a 3 hour layover. All my bags were carry on, so were my companions. However, upon boarding our last flight to Seattle, we were told that our bags were not carry on size. I asked for the opportunity to put it the bag sizer. I knew it would fit because I was previously asked to do this. This United employee would not allow me to do that. She just dismissed me and my companion and said that we had to check it. Very rude and unprofessional. I am on the flight now and there are empty seats and overhead space available. I will not be flying United again and nor will my companions. Very disappointed.",Detractor
"  Jakarta to Singapore. This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines and I was impressed. The flight was on time, the cabin crew was friendly and courteous. The cabin was really clean. It was a short haul flight which only lasted for 1 hr 45 mnt but really enjoyable. The food was decent for a short haul flight. It has 3-3-3 seat arrangement which is great and the legroom was spacious. I wish they could improve more on the flight entertainment system because even though the movie selection was great and had many new titles the touch screen was not responsive and the earphones were not comfortable enough",Promoter
"  Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. Lufthansa Duty Station Manager was visible and helpful at check-in. Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Premium economy seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is regular economy. If this is a well thought out marketing tool - I applaud LH, however I would prefer an entirely separate cabin with separate toilets (these became very dirty and did not appear to be attended to by the cabin crew for hours at a time). Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a Premium economy seat but were soon informed that there is an â€˜extra charge' for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11:30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent night's sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of Premium economy if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey. LH PE is NOT a watered down C Class product. It IS economy. However, the enhancements are good and sufficient to make a â€˜sky-snob' like me feel that it was money well spent and (sorry Lufthansa) money well-saved from the full C class fare. I felt that I was a premium passenger but was left in no doubt that the C class product (which could occasionally be peeked at through the curtains) was entirely superior - as it should be.",Promoter
Paris-Dubai on Emirates then Qantas from Dubai to Melbourne. We were simply amazed at how wonderful the Emirates experience was. The Economy class cabin was very well staffed the cabin crew were impeccably dressed and couldn't have been more attentive. We were offered drinks early in the flight and they even had a brandy on offer! On the six hour flight we were asked twice more if we would like another drink. The meal was good for Economy and we got little extras offered like an ice cream. On the Qantas QF10 flight Dubai-Melbourne we had paid the extra for the exit row seats in economy but to our horror we were seated in 48 B and C so were adjacent to the cabin crew's work areas and kitchens. Note to self- don't book these seats again on an A380! While the Qantas cabin crew were very friendly but we were not asked if we would like a drink of any kind until quite a way into the flight and then it was a small glass of cordial out of a jug. Then we were given a beef wrap (not bad) in a box (no tray) which was the last I saw of any service until two hours from Melbourne when I was offered a banana. Mind you I was sleeping for a lot of the flight so it's unfair to criticise as I didn't really need service but what would I have got had I been awake I wonder? The meal offered at the end of the flight looked very poor and I opted for cheese and biscuits. Sadly we concluded that we wouldn't fly Qantas again on a long haul flight if we could get an Emirates option at the same time. Compared to Emirates it would seem that everything about the inflight service on Qantas flights needs a big shake up. Our national airline looks and feels tired and will struggle to compete with the Middle Eastern airlines for much longer.,Detractor

"I recently flew from the States to Northern Europe using Norwegian Air. The whole trip was miserable. It started off with a 5 hour delay trying to get out of the States and ended up with my return flight home being operated by HiFly. I am extremely annoyed with Norwegian Air and the fact that I was forced to fly HiFly back to the States. HiFly certainly does not have the ""newest fleet in Europe"" and offers subpar service. After complaining about my experience with HiFly to my Norwegian Air rep he explained that it was common for Norwegian Air to use this company cause Norwegian Air does not have enough jets and often runs into trouble with delays and cancellations.

" Frankfurt to Bangkok via Bahrain in Business Class was quite nice. This was my first time to use Gulf Air at Frankfurt airport. So, I did not realized before that the airline lounge was located outside the passenger security control. After passing immigration and security control and coming inside, I was looking for the lounge and then I noticed that there was no lounge inside here. Gulf Air use Cathay Pacific Lounge, located before security control. Frankfurt to Bahrain used A320 aircraft which it is quite small aircraft but business class seat is very comfortable. I got a welcome drink, which was a lemon mint. Sky chef came out to suggest the menu, I chose grilled seabass with lime rice and dessert was German cheese cake and fresh fruit. The meal service was very nice and I was offered white wine too. Flight hours from Frankfurt to Bahrain is about 5 hours. So, only one meal service was served - I did expect to have hot tea or coffee with some small snack before landing. When arrived to Bahrain airport, passing through quick security control at transit area, I went directly to the business class Lounge. Staff in lounge attentive. Bahrain to Bangkok the seat is very nice and large space. Welcome drink offered, I chose fusion appetizers as starter and main course was honey duck. I did enjoy Gulf Air business class meal very much. After meal service, flight attendant came out to ask if I wanted my seat to be prepared as bed. Then they adjust my seat to be a bed with mattress and bed sheet. Their in-flight entertainment is nice, a lot of movies and musics, also games and information. About 1.50 hours before landing, flight attendant woke me up for breakfast which I was offered for fresh fruit, croissant, hot tea and juice.

"  I was pleasantly surprised by the experience, first time for premium economy with this particular airline. The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient. The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flight. The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight. We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours. It worked fine on the return journey and I guess it's just one of those things, just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored.",Promoter

I've flown EVA regularly over the last 2 years - premium economy for this last flight. Only relatively good value nowadays as other carriers are getting closer. Space on Elite class. 30% more money gets slightly wider seat and decent leg room. The downside is the seat pitch isn't that great in my opinion. Just a couple of degrees more would make a huge difference to sleep quality. Food and Drink. This was the real weak point of EVA until recently. Things are a little better. Inflight entertainment. Film selection is ok but not so good is the music. It doesn't change enough and really isn't that good for western tastes. Journey. Keeping the temperature above freezing this time was a relief! And being a night flight to BKK is great and getting back to LHR in the evening is also good. My biggest gripe? The passengers who open the window blinds (when its light outside) and ruin everyone's sleep. When the cabin goes dark the blinds should all stay firmly down.

" Montreal to Casablanca in April 2017. The flight was pretty good. I have no complains regarding that. My issue started when I was refused boarding on my way back. The reason that was given to me was that the flight was overbooked and they looked for volunteers to take the flight the next day. As a solo traveller I agreed to collaborate to help out, even though I was a losing a day of work. I was given a paper with which I would have to claim a compensation when I would be back in my town. When I began the process back at home, it seemed to go well at first. They answered e-mails and they had to reimburse me 75% of my ticket cost. Then they made me give them my bank details and then I never heard from them again. I could not reach them or the line would be cut as when you call them, you're probably redirected to Morocco itself. It is very hard to hear and understand. The representatives are not very nice or patient either. I was directed to the local office in Montreal where the only lady working there never returned my messages and she is never there. I simply gave up after having wasted quite a bit of time and effort. So, I never received the money and now I never want to fly with this company again.

" I flew from Athens to London Heathrow in Business Class. I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for ""free"". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members? During busy times, their C cabin needs more than one staff to keep up with the workload. I will be flying with them again soon though.",Passive
" I was flying from Copenhagen to Saint Petersburg via Moscow. With all flights on the route being served by Aeroflot. I had only 75 minutes to change in Sheremetyevo. Why do you let the booking systems to sell the tickets with such a small time to connect. It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it. So if you travel via Moscow's Sheremetyevo you have to have at least two hours for the transfer. I arrived in Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo airport with the next Aeroflot's flight, but my luggage didn't, it arrived two flight later almost at midnight. The ground service of Pulkovo airport offered me to wait for my luggage two and a half hours. They offered me to fill in some papers and lied that if I will put 24 hours contact permission, it will simply mean, that they will have a right to send me sms 24/7, in fact, I later figured out that it meant that they can deliver my luggage 24/7. The next day I call to Pulkovo luggage service to ask about my luggage delivery, and they inform me that I will only get it from 20:00 to 8:00, at night. So I took a taxi and came to Pulkovo myself and picked up my luggage. Aeroflot didn't compensate the money I've spent on a taxi.",Detractor
"This was our first time in first class and the experience was horrific! We flew to Montego Bay from Killeen Tx and when we arrived, our luggage did not. It would've been ok if they were courteous and respectful but they were horrible. We arrived at Montego Bay at 3.55pm and didn't get to speak with anyone about our luggage until 6.15 pm because the person who was suppose to be at our counter (AA) was ""busy assisting someone else"" as they kept telling us. When we did speak with someone, they informed me that our luggage was still in Dallas but will arrive first thing in the morning. We were excited to hear that and continued on to our resort. First thing in the morning came and went, afternoon came and went, evening came and went. We had the hotel call the airport (we tried calling ourselves but the room phone wouldn't properly dial out the 800 number) they were told the luggage would be here soon. Our luggage came at 11 pm the second night we were there. Our vacation was only for 6 days, two days have already passed when we received it. No one knows why we didn't get it until and when the resort called they kept lying (AA representative) and said it was already on its way and would be here in two hours. We heard two hours for two days. Fast forward 8 days. We used AA once again for our trip to Aruba which was 8 days after this first disaster. When we go to check in (again first class/business class) the airline double booked us and had us flying to multiple locations. AA rep informed us we would have to check in at counter. We went to check in at the counter and it took us TWO hours, yes two hours to fix our reservations. I am traveling with my SO who is a disabled veteran (we both are veterans) who was told he had to stand those two hours because they didn't have a wheelchair available for him. It takes AA two hours to issue us tickets and then they change our flights making our stay in Aruba airport 4 hours. When I expressed how disappointed we were the AA rep informed me that this is the norm for AA. He said we shouldn't be complaining about only waiting two hours to get our tickets printed. He was rude along with the manager who kept talking in Spanish. We fly often, very often using American Airlines and we are embarrassed for you guys treating customers this way.",Detractor

 In July 2018 I booked a flight from Edmonton to Iceland through a travel agency for December 15 2018. I called Icelandair to upgrade my seat and was advised that my flight was cancelled completely. Due to this I am out $356 for my hotel. I requested Icelandair reimburse my lost money due to their cancellation and was advised by their reservations that nothing would be done and no compensation would be given. I asked multiple times to let me speak to a supervisor and was told I would not be sent to a supervisor. I am extremely disappointed that Icelandair is taking no action on my lost expenses due to their changes. The treatment and not being able to speak to a supervisor was also extremely disappointing.

"  I took TK flights from Kiev to Manila with a stopover in Istanbul. Kiev to Istanbul was a short flight and everything went very well arrived on time. From Istanbul to Manila flight is after midnight and I spent some time in the lounge. This is by far the best lounge but this is only applicable in terms of hardware and in terms of F&B products. Soft skills, understanding of Service and how tired a passenger can be is not the concern of employees. Star Alliance passengers also patronize this lounge which makes it super crowded. Boarding is another mess ground staff creates group to ease the boarding, however it doesnt help at all. Many economy class passengers use Business class lane and this is acceptable by staff. Flight was perfect, in the past the crew was not attentive though they gradually improved their standards and current status is extremely good. Chef on board served fantastic F&B, entertainment and free WiFi is simply excellent. Arrival to Manila was on time.",Promoter

All in all not a bad experience at all. The Business Class lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport (Concourse E) was nice and clean couches were comfortable and there was a reasonable variety of food to eat. Only criticisms are that there should have been more types of fruit to choose from. Our Boeing 777-300 seats in business class had a very generous amount of leg room. The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.,Passive
 Athens to Johannesburg via Cairo. Very pleasant flight experience. Plane slightly dated without all the bells and whistles of Emirates. However crew very friendly and service on board great. The Purser in charge of our flight welcomed every one personally at their seat and apologized later in person for the delayed flight departure.

Only to return to the terminal with a cancelled flight with no accommodations or a new departure. Had to go all the way back to the ticket check in desk to tell me the next available flight for my trip would be when I was to return from my vacation 2 whole days later.

My family of 3 flew economy class SEA-KEF-AMS. Inflight entertainment was good for adults. It might be best for the longer flights to bring extra movies for children as there wasn't too much for them besides two movies and a bunch of episodes of Lazytown. Seating was a bit crammed but get what you pay for. The nicest part was the effort on the part of the airline to keep us all seated together without trying to gouge us or blow us off like other airlines. Customer service appears to still have a pulse with Icelandair. There was only a slight delay with one of the four flights but we still managed to leave on time. We read about the food for pay thing ahead of time and packed our own meals. Our child's airline provided meal was brought hot and early in the flight and she was happy with it.

I cannot understand why Ryanair allows each passenger to take a carry on bag on board if there is only space for half of them in the overhead locker. The flight attendant stuffed my bag under the seat in front of me and I was very uncomfortable. I chose a nice looking brown bread sandwich from the booklet and of course it was not available. I have to say though that the flight attendants on this flight Paphos - Thessaloniki on 12 Sep 2013 were very friendly. On the way back on Sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then I had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. The female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to Paphos If was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board. The male flight attendant drank from a water bottle closed the toilet door with his foot and counted the money at the end of the service in the front where all passengers could see.,Detractor

"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.",Detractor
" The worst airline that I have ever been on. I booked my trip through Expedia. First of all they wanted me to pay for my carry on, it was the correct dimension and it was not overweight, but they only allow you to carry a backpack. Every other airline lets you have a carry on for free. They wanted to charge me 60 dollars for my carry on, of course they don't tell you that before purchasing your ticket. I showed my military ID and asked them if they have a discount, usually other airlines have discounts on bags. They told me I was wrong and they don't accommodate military personnel. I had to go to their website and show that they do offer a free baggage check for military personnel. When I did this, the lady gave me so much attitude. Finally after arguing with this lady, I got onboard the plane just to find out we are going to be delayed because they can't find the co-pilot. My flight from Cancun to Fort Lauderale was late and I had only 45 min to pick up my bags and go through Customs/TSA. I ran through the airport, just as I was getting to the gate, a Spirit worker came on the speaker saying we had 5 min. I ran and saw him go into the doors with 3 min left. I knocked on the glass door so he could let me in, but he just turned around and ignored me. He came back later to tell me he went to close the door and I have to go to customer service. I went to customer service and they told me I won't be able to get another flight until 6pm the next day. This didn't work for me because the next day I had a flight to Barcelona at 5.30pm. They told me they can't do anything for me and doubt I have a flight to Barcelona. I was willing to show them my confirmation with Expedia but they didn't want to hear it. The only reason they put me on stand by was because I talked to the supervisor. I had to buy a brand new ticked with AA for 371 dollars. I will never again travel on this airline.",Detractor

Amsterdam to Bangkok Business class. Booked seats 9 months before travel and selected seats. On check in day found computer had decided to sit us on opposite sides of the aircraft: as it was our 40th wedding anniversary celebration didn't go down well. Eventually managed to get two seats together. Boarding at Amsterdam was a bit chaotic. Aircraft was B777-300: unsure of the age of the plane but business class cabin in my opinion looked drab and dingy when compared to say Qatar. Seats were OK and everything worked. AVOD worked but choice of movies was definitely limited. Food choice was also limited and wine selection was restricted. General comfort was OK. The really good aspect of this flight was the cabin crew. They were extremely attentive and welcoming especially the senior purser and they were all very professional. In spite of that I will not be considering KLM again especially as the flights undertaken do not appear to have been added to my Flying Blue account.,Passive
Travelled LHR to Montreal 21st August 2014 and Montreal to LHR 1st September 2014. Aircraft used was a 777-200 with 4 classes. This sector does not normally offer a First service so business class passengers were spread throughout the First and Club World cabins. All flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. Check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. The lounges at Terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup. Seating in BA is dated and even BA's new First Class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as Emirates or Qatar. Food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. I know BA is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. I guess there is little competition for BA on the north Atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the Far East and Australia are diminishing.,Passive

Check-in at Dublin was chaotic. We had no way to print our boarding passes and they were not downloadable.

Picked Spirit because they offered the cheapest price for my flight. However you don't get to all the hidden fees until it's too late! I spent nearly the same amount of money paying for fees like carry-on fees fees to pick a seat and then water isn't even complimentary inflight. In the end I'd rather fly with a better airline if the price is the same. Not choosing spirit for future travels. Not recommended unless you are traveling with just a personal bag not an actual carry-on luggage. Unbelievable. What was supposed to be an affordable flight turned into a bait and switch situation. I'd rather pay full price than be deceived. Do not pick seats in row 10 as they do not recline.,Detractor

"Austrian is my favourite airline to cross the Atlantic. I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasn't happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I won't make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesn't have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, it's very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering I've ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore. I love flying with Austrian!",Promoter
"Excellent total experience with Turkish Airlines at a very good price from Birmingham to Kathmandu via IST. We booked our own flights with a package holiday. This meant we could fly from our local airport, get seats that were 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3 for the long flight and save nearly Â£700. It was easy to book window seats on the left for a good view of the Himalayas on the way in - just phone them 99 days before the flight. I got through very easily (in contradiction to what other reviews say) and was treated with respect. No charge for seats. I chose 30A and B for the long flight to be behind the wings - they were good but a few seats further back would have been even better. Complementary food and drinks and was better than most airlines. You even get metal cutlery. Good, clean modern aircraft. Entertainment system worked fine on all 4 flights. Good cabin crew.

Check in was prompt and efficient, but boarding was chaotic - probably more due to airport procedures than the airline itself.

It delayed boarding and in reality, it was a perfunctory opening the bag and casually looking through, without any additional benefits to security.

"An amazing flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. Counter agent was upfront about the how full the flight was when asked about a possible upgrade. He tried several times to see if it was possible, but everything was booked up. Proceeded to the Cathay Pacific Lounge at YVR. Not the best, however a nice quiet spot to sit and relax before the 14 hour flight. Flight was delayed due to a late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Unfortunately, the gate agents (who were also the ticket agents) didn't update the YVR passengers on when we would be able to board. The cabin crew for this part of the flight were also waiting with us and they didn't have any ideas on when we would be able to depart. Eventually, approximately an hour later, we all boarded and took off for HKG. Service on board was amazing. The initial drink service into the dinner service was quick and efficient. However, the snacks weren't ""served"" in Premium Economy, as most of us were asleep in the cabin. I got up and walked around the cabin and got the snacks myself.

"Sadly this airline struggles to deliver time after time. They own the 'worst ever flying experience' tag after a 12 hour airport delay in Seville a few years back and judging by recent experiences they still have room for improvement. My latest involved a 3 hour delay on a hot Saturday afternoon. It was apparent that the 'delayed departure' time was never credible and sure enough no sooner had we settled in our uncomfortable leg roomed seats a further announcement was made. Sadly a relief crew had to be called in as the current one would have breached their permitted maximum hours of work had they continued. I addressed the issue with the captain and asked why he had not called operations earlier, surely he had realised earlier. Muffled response. I also suggested he chased operations after the relief crew also arrived after 'time'. The 150 odd passengers had to sit around while they finally got their act together. As a token gestutre they offered a cup of still water and a McD hamburger to those desiring same. Until incompetence and sub standard performances of airlines are felt in their bottom lines (ie they have to offer monetary compensation to their loyal customers) I see little changing.

" Hong Kong to Bangkok. Having just flown Heathrow to Hong Kong with Virgin Upper Class you would think the 2 hour hop across to Bangkok with Thai Airways would be a somewhat underwhelming experience, the reality was anything but. As soon as we stepped into the Royal Silk cabin it was as though the weight of the world was lifted from our shoulders and we could begin our holiday in Thailand. The staff were fantastic and genuinely there to make you flight as pleasant as possible. The Virgin staff were ok but essentially it was all about them, the Thai Airways staff were there to look after you. The cabin staff on the return leg Bangkok to Hong Kong on Jan 5th in particular were quite superb and deserve special mention. The cabin feels spacious with aisle access for all seats and is arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern. Alternate window seats have slightly better window access and are set slightly in from the aisle. The seat converts to a full flat bed but we didn't put it to the test on such a short flight. The meal BKK to HKG was a lamb massaman and actually very edible, a selection of cheeses, additional crackers were gladly provided upon asking. A couple of deserts were offered and they insisted we try both as the flight was not full so there was enough to go round. Check in at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport was relaxed and courteous with a dedicated Royal Silk international drop off zone. There were even seats for you during the check in process. Didn't particularly use the in flight entertainment system, the rest of the family managed to squeeze in a film. No qualms about recommending this flight, lasting memory would be the staff, a credit to Thai Airways.",Promoter

I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.,Promoter

"We flew from Hong Kong to London Heathrow on 23 October. The flight left 35 minutes late. The first problem was that Cathay Pacific had not registered my vegetarian meal and were in the process of allocating this to a surprised passenger nearby (who was willing to accept it). When we let them know that it was me that had ordered the vegetarian option the crew said that It ""shouldn't be a problem - there was probably a spare vegetarian meal aboard"". Not what you want to hear at the start of a 13 hour flight. For the record the other partners on the flights involved (Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand) had registered my request and made it clear within minutes of our arrival onboard that they knew where to deliver the vegetarian meal. We saw the cabin crew for the two meals and on three occasions after - the other aisle was serviced our aisle had little assistance. I was awake for about two thirds of the flight so I didn't miss them while I was asleep. We had to almost grab a steward to hand over our rubbish. This was not Premium Economy this was cattle class with extra legroom. Never again. Next time we fly we will avoid Cathay Pacific.",Detractor
" . I fly from MYR to MCI 4 or 5 times a year for family reasons. I have resigned myself to a one-stop connection thru CLT with an overall 5-6 hour travel time. So you can imagine how surprised I was to find a nonstop flight listed on Expedia. But it's on Spirit Airlines and everything I hear about them is not so good. So this is my candid review. I expected counter personnel and flight attendants to be rude and unhelpful. This was not the case. The FA's clearly demonstrated on both flights they can TCB and still be pleasant. When I first arrived at the gate in MYB the sign indicated the flight would be delayed 2 hours. I thought it might be an indication the bad stuff I heard about Spirit was starting already. However the gate attendant gave us an update every ten minutes about the departure status and the 2 hour delay turned out to be only 55 minutes. Once aboard, the first thing I noticed was the seats. They quickly remind you that you're flying an LCC. They are cheaply made rack type seats with very little padding, no headrest, and they do not recline. Very uncomfortable for 2.5 hours. Everything on board is at a price, including water. Again, the LCC thing. The aircraft seemed to be fairly new and the interior all appeared in good shape. However, it was clear the floor had not been vacuumed in quite some time. For the most part the flight was pleasant. The thing that bothers me most was the price to check a bag. My bag weighed 23.5 pounds according to their scale and I was charged $50 to check it. I thought this was exorbitant. If I had chosen to carry the bag on I would have been charged as well. The LCC thing again. So, in summary, their people were great, their seats were very uncomfortable, and their baggage fees are overpriced. Would I fly them again? Yes. I am willing to put up with a few disappointments in order to get a nonstop flight. A 2.5 hour trip instead of 5 hours is worth a certain amount of trade off.",Passive
AMS-OPO. Flight initially delayed by 1 hour. We were informed at the airport so it wasn't that bad. Flight itself was fine I was expecting worse.

I was expecting worse (based of stories from others) but it wasn't that bad.,Passive
 Orlando to Atlanta. Horrible airline. Will not allow online check ins so that your bag fees are cheaper. I was told today when booking with Expedia you don't get that option. Airport checking is 50 for bag up to 40lbs. And additional 55 for bags 51-75 giving the impression that that 50 is the weight limit. No posted info on bags 40-50. Paid 116 for ticket and 155 I.

I have only flown this airline once (RT) and will never fly them again. Both times the flight was delayed once by 1/2 hour and once by 2.5 hours. They actually had the nerve to post 'on time' on the electronic board along with the rescheduled departure time. When I questioned the 'on time' the customer service agent said they hadn't yet updated the sign. Um then why does it say 11.30 instead of 9.35? Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed. If you are needing to get somewhere especially if you have a connection I strongly advise you avoid Frontier and if you must pay a little extra for an airline that cares about their customers getting to where they want to go relatively on time.,Detractor

VIE-BKK-VIE in Business Class. New seats are a significant step up from the previous product. Had 3A on the way out and 7K back and the seats had excellent room lots of space for storage and comfortable for sleeping fully flat and relaxing. Topped off by the excellent food and beverage service with a trolley bringing out soup and 2 other starters 3 hot options and 2 desserts plus ice cream. A standard of food service you don't see on business class elsewhere. Only bettered by the coffee service with about 10 different coffee combinations on offer. The in flight entertainment screens are large and responsive with the only disappointment being the extremely small selection. I didn't mind as both flights left just before midnight so after dinner it was time for sleep. Service from the crew was excellent. Austria's only weak point in the past was the angled lie-flat seats now it has seats that are up there with the best.

"LHR to Shannon return on a rather cramped small plane. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service, as I had heard this airline referred to as ""Air Fungus!"" It was an enjoyable flight, and the FA's were friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the Captain's announcements in Irish Gaelic, even though I couldn't understand it, but he repeated it in English. The gent next to me ordered a toasted sandwich, which took so long to be delivered he had to gulp it down as we were landing, and even then he only had time to eat half of it. A pleasing alternative to using that ""Other Irish Airline"". My only other quibble, and it's a nit-picky one, is that the female FA uniform contains too many varying shades of Teal/Aqua, and doesn't quite gel together, but I'm no fashion expert. I would certainly fly Aer Lingus again.",Passive

Boarding was delayed for about 40 minutes and we ended up asked to board last again, even though our seats were in the middle of the aircraft. Once aboard staff were fast to serve dinner as soon as the aircraft fully completed take off. blankets were handed out rather fast as well, and lights were dimmed. Aircon was at a pleasant temperature for the whole flight. During the evening flight staff were passing by and were available when we needed water or juice. Flight arrived on time despite the delays on the ground. Landing at Barajas was very smooth and pleasant.

"  Brussels to Toronto via Reykjavik. There are many reasons why I will not be choosing this airline again. There is no value in doing so. Baggage is extra (checked bag-$95, carry on-$70) You have to pay to choose your seats online and if you don't, you will be seated separately than your travelling partners. No food or beverage is provided and even items such as water are about $5. There are no TV screens on the plane. They hassle people about the size of their (paid) carry on and warn people that if it seems too large there will be an extra charge. When all the extra charges and hassle are taken into account, the value for the money is 0. You can find other airlines that are very similar in price that include all of the things that WOW air deems extra. I cannot think of a single positive thing that this airline provided me, not even a cheaper price than other airlines.

"  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time. I will never fly with them again and I would recommend others to choose another airline.",Detractor

"Manchester to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The check in process went ok, when it came to boarding we were late boarding and late leaving - pilot did say it was to do with traffic at Manchester but if you check this flight daily it does not often leave on time think it is due to the fact the plane has come in that morning about an hour earlier, not enough time to get passengers off and plane cleaned. When it came to the food there was three options for main choice, but by the time the stewardess got to us there was only one choice left. The seat space was tight. On our return journey the initial check in was great - but then it all turned into a mess, as we got called to the gate and had to stand in a long line and queue to have our passports checked, various hand luggage was also been checked here. Why is this not done at security? Once we got our passports checked we were then stood in the gate area which was filling up fast, people all stood in front of the glass doors - when boarding then started they called for passengers in zone 3 and we had to fight our way through the crowds to board the plane. The food came round and once again they had run out of out the chicken course again - I did not like the other options and the stewardess then said there was some crew meals we could have, so she went away and came back with a meal which she described as a low calorie chicken dish - it turned out to be fish! One dish I do not eat good job I did not have an allergy to fish! I appreciate menu did say if your first choice is not available they apologise, but this happened on flight both ways.

"easyJet from Manchester to Belfast. I don't ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival, so I am rarely moved to write a review. However, on this occasion I think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an ""upfront fee"" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: ""Excuse me Sir"" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology.

" Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid. Even some cheap airlines gives food that is better than the food served in Emirates airlines and they served the same food in both flights although they were in different times. The seat size is ok but the quality of the touch screen can be improved.",Passive
"  Seoul to Singapore. The cabin was relatively good, with the nice burrito snack and meals. The staff were attentive and service was not bad. Seat pitch was good. The inflight entertainment was Korea-centric with limited English program options. However, I was dissatisfied with the booking system and calling system as well as their treatment of customer during disputes. Apparently we booked our flight on OZ753 on 19 June from Seoul to Singapore at 1930 as they had rescheduled our flight an hour later from 1830 on April 13. I had called the company hotline and ask if it is possible to reschedule us on the flight to an earlier flight. They told us the earlier flight is full and put us on standby. However, there was no follow up call. We thought all was fine. Until we reach the airport, we could not self check in at the airport or check in online. The ground staff tried to solve the issue but could not. So she called for the duty manager who told us that it is our fault for not removing the standby and secure our seats for the later flight. As a passenger, we will not be familiar with the airline company policies regarding such resolving such issues.",Detractor

" Delhi to Lucknow. The most inconvenient flight I've boarded in my entire life. First, they put me in an international flight, from Delhi to Lucknow. The entire flight was full of men hardly 5 female boarded the plain other than me. I was given a seat in the middle of two creepy men constant trying to tap my hands and legs. The refreshment - 2 butter cookies and a juice carton worth 20 bucks. Disgrace! One good thing they do on domestic flights is at least serve a veg wrap & muffin - especially morning. To further add to my frustration, the porters shared the domestic luggage half an hour later on the belt, where the international luggage was put within the first 5 minutes. Half of the luggage anyway was going back in the connecting flight for the passengers. What a crazy morning! Never taking Air India again.",Detractor

Order the Chef was a great choice with the lobster as with all meals and excellent selection of wines. Was very impressed how this felt very Thai and authentic. Sleeping was not a problem and quite comfortable.

"During a recent flight from Melbourne to Milan, Etihad Airways lost our luggage for 5 days. I would call Airport Handling (Etihad's lost luggage agent at Malpensa airport) and after holding for about 10 minutes an automated voice would say â€˜Our representatives are busy on other calls and cannot help you now. Please call back later'. The call would then terminate. It was incredibly frustrating. The only phone number I could find for Etihad was a ticket reservation number which went through to a call centre in Ireland. The representative there told me that he could not assist. The only means of contact I could find to contact Etihad was the complaints forum on its website. After not hearing anything for two weeks, I emailed again, and it seems that Etihad never received my complaint. Apart from one email from Etihad Airways asking when I sent my original complaint, I never heard back from the airline. I have contacted them four times to the prescribed email address, and never heard back. No assistance, apology or proper communication was given by Etihad Airways. The situation was handled appallingly. It ruined our holiday.

"My family and I (2 adults, 1 child) had purchased my tickets to DXB-SAL-DXB and at the same time, had paid additional so that I could select my seats. On entering the flight, we noticed that someone was already seated on our pre-purchased seats, which was 8D, 8E and 8F. We contacted the stewardess and told her of the issue. She asked us to temporarily sit on one of the vacant seats while she gets things sorted out. My wife and child were seated on empty seats while I was standing waiting for the issue to be resolved as passengers entered and took our seats. Finally, the stewardess came and told us that we could be seated at seats 30A, 30B and 30C. Furthermore, people who were assigned to those seats were moved to the front of the flight at random seats. This ended up being a problem for them as they had to wait till most of the passengers had disembarked from the flight so that they could move to the back of the plane to collect their luggage from the overhead cabins, where it was initially stored. I understand under normal circumstances whereby the seats were randomly assigned to us. However, these were paid seats and instead of seating the people who had taken our seats to their respective seats, we were pushed all the way to the back of the flight. This is unacceptable and I do not see any reason why an organization of this repute would agree to such a policy. Secondly, there was no explanation or request on the stewardesses part - she just told us those were the seats she had allocated for us. The flight itself was satisfactory. Seats were a little tight, and the touch screen display facing my seat was not working.",Detractor
"  Baltimore to Las Vegas via Charlotte. What a disappointment! When I checked in 2 hours early I was told my flight was on time, by the time I ate a meal and went to my gate the flight had been delayed about 15 minutes. I had a scheduled layover in Charlotte for 90 mins so at this time I wasn't to worried. As the time passed the delay got longer and longer. My flight was scheduled to leave at 5:15pm. Needless to say we did not depart until 6:45pm. The flight that I was to be connecting to was going up in the air when we were descending. When we got off that flight went straight to customer service to find another flight to get me to Las Vegas that night as I already had reservations at the hotel. No flight was available until the following morning at 8am. So I lost out on 1 night of my hotel reservation plus another 1/2 day worth of travel. The airport did put me in a hotel for the night instead of having to sleep in the airport but that did not get me my time back. I then had to book another night in Las Vegas so that I could enjoy what time I was supposed to be there. On the return flights, the attendant at the desk in Las Vegas at the gate was very rude to customers. For being a 6:45 am flight I hate to see what she was like by the end of her shift. 3 of the 4 planes were old, no in flight entertainment was provided on 3 flights.

" Portland to Paris via Seattle with Delta Air Lines. Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers. Flying with low cost companies is better than Delta!",Detractor

The catering department obviously do not understand what gluten free means. While the normal menu offered choices the gluten free offering did not. The offerings were generally tasteless, even gluten free food from the main menu had been removed and the basis for the menu seemed to be vegetarian and dairy free, even butter and jam were taken out. We cannot understand what inspires a caterer to provide mixed boiled vegetables for breakfast! Having experienced this catering disaster outbound to New Zealand we addressed the issue with cabin staff on the return leg from Auckland to Hong Kong and the flight crew were extremely helpful and arranged more palatable meals from the main menu. They cannot be faulted. Needless to say we cannot recommend this airline to passengers with special dietary requirements until this problem has been properly addressed.",Passive
"  A few complaints about my flight from San Francisco to Bangkok via Guangzhou. On the way, one of my two pieces of luggage was delayed by 24 hours! This meant I had to miss my Bangkok tour while I waited for it to arrive. Traveling through China was a disaster. I thought it was nice that they escorted me from the airplane to the China Southern lounges, but they refused to let me explore the airport (felt like they were keeping me prisoner) and the food was of low quality. This became an issue when I had to spend 6 hours in Guangzhou. Additionally, they escorted me about 3/4 mile on foot to the domestic airport only to realize that they had taken me to the wrong lounge. They then made me walk all the way back to the international airport to the lounge there. Also, getting seat assignments ahead of time was really difficult, as I had to call China! Lastly, the gluten-free meals consisted of sushi shrimp (ugh) and other weird items. The good news was the business-class seats for the overseas portion were really nice and the staff was pleasant. But when I got home, it took 1 hour for them to unload my luggage! This applied to everyone who had a stopover in China. Again, unacceptable for business class and the agent at SFO was not at all pleasant. The moral of the story is not to fly through China on the way to anywhere if possible!",Detractor

" Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City with a change of planes in San Francisco to SLC (1 hr 32 min.) Airline travel is hard enough without punitive agents. On March 31 we were making a coast-to-coast trip after our cruise. Our return tickets from Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City were with United purchased through Expedia. Our day started at 4 am. Most airlines that I know of allow a carry on and a personal item policy. We chose the United flight because it got us back at a decent hour so we could make the 3.5-hour drive back to our home in Idaho. We had tried to print our boarding passes online with the ship's computer/printer but were unable to with the directive we would have to see an agent at the airport. We were informed, when were arrived at the airport, that we would have to check our carry on bags because of the nature of the ticket we purchased. We weren't happy about it but did so at the extra cost of $25 a bag. We had purchased a basic economy flight ticket so that did not allow a carry on. We were placed in the very back row 38 and had a bumpy and straight-backed ride for over 6 hours. Fair enough. On arriving at San Francisco for our transfer flight of an hour and a half to SLC we had something to eat and waited. We were the last passengers to board the plane. As we were being checked in the United Agent stopped my wife. He/she said the carry on bag of my wife needed to be checked even though we had just gotten off a United jet of the same size and model so there was no question that it fit under the seat and that is the criteria that was listed by Expedia and United: â€œCarry-on bags are limited to one personal item that fits under the seat in front of you.â€ I have to interject here that my wife has used this same personal carry on bag for over 20 years of flying with all the major airlines United, Delta, American, Alaskan, and Frontier. No airline agent of flight attendant had ever given her a problem because of its size or dimensions (9x9x18). It always fit easily under the seat, even with the small computer planes that have much shorter routes with much smaller jets. My wife was forced to give up her personal bag before she could board the flight. My wife sent me on to board since my protests were falling on deaf ears. But after taking about 10 steps I turned around and went back to ask the agent if this had anything to do with the ticket we had purchased through Expedia? She/he said yes. So I went to board. My wife boarded about 3-5 minutes later and when she reached our back seats she was seething. She told me to guess what they had charged her to check her personal bag. I guessed $25? No. $50? No. She was charged $175.00! She told me she had felt bullied and belittled by what took place. This whole experience has soured us both towards flying with United Airlines. We have frequent flyer numbers with the airlines and this incident was completely out of character for the airlines that tout the â€œFriendly Skiesâ€. It was illogical and unprofessional to treat loyal customers in that way.",Detractor

" Las Vegas to Dallas. Terrible flight with rude staff at the Dallas gate. My flight departed Vegas at 12pm & we did not arrive on Dallas until 9pm!

I asked for corporates number for complaints (I'm sure they have one cause they suck) he gives me the regular customer service number I already found online.

Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored.

"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead!",Detractor

" Los Angeles to Manila via Incheon. My experience with Asiana Airlines is not as exciting as I thought it would be. At LAX, boarding was chaotic. They don't have an organized boarding system. Everybody rushed in to board no matter what your seat number is. I found this to be very frustrating. The service is pretty much comparable to other premier Asian carriers. The economy seats are quite similar as well, although it has more cushion and softer. The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China. Because of this, I promised myself not to book future flights with Asiana. The B747 for the connecting flight was refreshing as it is wider than the B777 and the seats are more comfortable.

On-line check-in did not allow seat change and request for aisle seat resulted in row 32 way in the back of the 737-800. Flight was 40 minutes late due to mechanical problems in the flight deck (lights) and then a passenger table tray. Flight attendants did bare minimum with one bar service and then water was only available in back galley for the remainder of the 4 hour flight. United really a disappointment.

OSL-ZRH-BOS in First. I flew OSL-ZRH in Business food just ok service great seating ok. Arrived in Zurich went to the First lounge. Open and clean with good choices of food and drinks. But not stunning in any way. But they had a restaurant there with pretty good options and wine also a big liquor trolley. After some hours me and four more passengers where driven to terminal E for boarding in a Caravelle mini van. Upon boarding I was greeted by the Captain and the Maitre de Cabin and two other very nice FA`s. The cabin feels opulent but not bling like EK. Food was the best I have had in the air wine list good but not the best. Service was very good but I prefer BA. 4/8 in F so we all got window seats. This was a day flight but still I wanted to sleep a couple of hours. They made my bed beside me so I could go to sleep when I felt like it. All in all a great experience.,Promoter

The flight attendants were very professional and courteous, and some very funny. The drinks are reasonably priced also. When I got to Cleveland, I got all the way to the baggage return, picked up my bag, waited outside for 10 minutes for my ride, and then realized I didn't have my wallet. I of course go racing back inside and find the first Southwest Airlines employee I can, because I am well beyond TSA checkpoints and can't get back to the gate.

The outbound Ryanair flight was fine and ran to schedule however the return flight was a different matter entirely. On 11th December the country was suffering some severe weather and Ryanair cancelled every inbound and outbound flight to Dublin. I appreciate that safely is of upmost importance but many other airlines were still operating with the majority of Air Lingus flights still flying in and out. There was no explanation why this was so. The next available free transfer to another Ryanair flight out of Dublin was 6 days later. We managed to book on an Air Lingus flight a day later. The refund from Ryanair was paid promptly but it would have been nice to receive information as to why there was a blanket cancellation of all of their flights on the day when other airlines were still operating.,Passive
"  Barcelona to Rome. Take note of checking in online prior to your flight else you have to pay an arm an leg to get your boarding pass printed at the check in counter, which was expected of a normal airline check in. To make the situation worse, the 45 euro / pax penalty was not stated during the purchasing process or on our etickets. After queuing for almost an hour at the check in line of Ryanair, we were slapped in the face by an impatient check in officer who just rolled her eyes and  said that 'sorry the online check in just ckosed 2mins ago'. And rudely shooed us to the other counter to make payment as she hurried to attend another customer. She said no payment, no boarding, and just shrugged her shoulders. To rub salt in the wound, We were told we could have checked in while waiting in the queue. How would we have known when there was no signage whatsoever while we were queuing. At the 'payment counter' there was another 20 mins queue with more than 30 other passengers paying their penalty. What a great way to easily earn a few thousand extra euro per flight. Anyone who travels will agree that wifi can be inconsistent and even unavailable for a period in a foreign country. After boarding, flight was dirty with food bits and paper on the cabin floor.

"When I arrived at the airport I got into the check-in line although I had my printed boarding pass. Seeing other passengers approach a separate window that appeared to be there to sell tickets or collect overcharges, I approached, showed my passport and boarding pass and asked if I needed to remain in the check in queue. That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized. Print boarding pass before you get to the airport. If you printed your boarding pass, you can go directly to the gate. I was able to check in my rolling bag for free because the flight was nearly full and there was need for overhead space. Weigh your hand luggae and ensure it is within the rules.

My first TK A330-300 trip my first Y experience on TK for a long time. The plane was full. I have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional.

I have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it. Never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand. It was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth. Slow inattentive service. Good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time. On the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than I'm used to Thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones I was happy.

Baltimore to San Diego via Houston. The worst experience I've had with an airline. I tried checking in on the website and it wouldn't take my card. So I decided to call Spirit and pay over the phone. I soon came to realize that they charge more over the phone and I probably declined to pay more money. I had to go find a computer elsewhere for it to work. The day of my flight when I went to check in my bags the staff was rude and other customers were treated poorly as well. My flight was delayed three hours because ATC had to route my flight to Houston because of storms. I am under 5 feet tall and I felt as though the seats were too small and there wasn't enough room. When I sat down I came to realize that the plane was filthy. My next flight was also delayed and the customer service reps were rude and kept us in the dark. My flight was scheduled to leave at 9 PM but we ended up leaving at close to 1 AM. I might as will also have paid for bigger airline since they nickel and dime you for everything.

"  New York to Porto Alegre via Sao Paolo. I have no complaints for the service on the plane, but I will never fly with LATAM again. The customer service with the airline at the airport is horrible and you'll find yourself pulling teeth trying to figure out what exactly is going on. Everybody gives you a different answer for questions you have regarding your flights and it's extremely frustrating trying to deal with those who work for the airline (again, not as flight attendants but airport workers). On the way to Porto Alegre from JFK, I had a connecting flight in Sao Paolo. Since it was international to domestic, we had to pick up our bags and transfer them to the correct terminal. My sister checked her bag in and never saw it again since the woman working there sent it to a completely different city in Brazil. The entire time, my sister received no word on her bag and it wasn't until we got back to JFK in NY that we realized they found the bag in Sao Paolo (since it got sent back). This didn't matter though since when we got to JFK, 4 more bags were missing and we had no idea where they were. We were traveling with nine checked in bags and only received five when we got back to New York. Two of the bags missing were mine and I went home with absolutely no clothes, shoes, or gifts. After traveling 14 hours, this was rather frustrating and the response from LATAM employees at the airport was even more frustrating. They said how they didn't know how it happened and that sometimes security kept the bags extra to check them before sending them on the plane. I didn't think this made sense since five of the nine bags had been sent. They told us they'd ""try their best"" to find them and to keep our phones nearby just in case they found them on the next flight. It was just ridiculous that not one, but 5 bags had been lost during our experience with LATAM. Needless to say, this was the last time I would be flying with LATAM and I will makes sure to look into any other airline I use before flying with them.",Detractor

"  I completely understand the negative reviews of Spirit but, if you want to save money, actually understand the rules, and are willing to deal with tight seating, mediocre customer service, and a spotty on-time record, Spirit might work for you. Anything other than a personal item will cost you extra. This is very clearly explained when you're booking. Deal with it. Seating is tight and not particularly comfortable. This is also explained during booking. Deal with it. If you need overhead space, pay to board early or take your chances. This isn't rocket science. Aside from potentially saving some serious cash, the biggest perk on Spirit is the credit card application deal they offer on some flights. Fill out a credit card app in-flight and you get a 2,500 mile voucher for free. That's good for a free one-way flight. It's not for everyone, but if you play your cards right, Spirit can definitely work out for you.",Promoter

" We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",Detractor
" On 22th of August 2018, I was traveling with OA flight 254 Athens to Mytilene operated by Aegean. I am a gold member and with me were travelling my parents, my father with special assistance as he has had a coronary angiography. When I went to the lounge and asked at the front office to have my parents as guests, the answer was that I can take only one guest and it's not possible to take both because the regulation is that only one guest can go with a Gold member. I replied that I know the regulation but due my father's health circumstances, if they could make an exception and he could sit in a quiet place until boarding the aircraft, the response was again negative, only my father could come with me and my mother should wait outside. At this point I was wondering what would be happening if my mother came with us in an almost empty lounge. Probably they were afraid that they would eat the cheeses at the buffet. I was expecting something more from Aegean as they advertise all the time that: Aegean is civilization, they definitely have a strange idea about what civilization is.",Passive

The seats were the ones used before smoking was banned and still had the ash-trays covered by metal plates riveted in place. The only fruit juices available were orange or grapefruit. Hard luck if you like a Bloody Mary. Breakfast was, without doubt, the worst I have ever had on any airline. It consisted of a squashed sort of bread finger, with a mushy filling, which had been microwaved to the point of intangibility, a fruit flavoured yoghurt, which I believe had never seen real fruit, a small pastry (the most edible part of the meal), and tea or coffee (instant I think) with a packet of that non-dairy creamer stuff.

"  Mytilene to London Heathrow via Athens return. As always, a pleasure to fly with Aegean. Cabin crew were very friendly, efficient and professional, plane was clean. Food was ok, it's not 5 star fine dining but much appreciated even on a 3.5 - 4 hr flight. Lovely wine. Landed early in ATH as is nearly always the case. ATH - MJT was a full flight and about 35 mins in the air with a drinks service followed by a breakfast snack service followed by coffee tea service (those cabin crew were constantly on the move and smiling). One thing that I'm not keen on is the pre allocated seating which is a pain especially if you want a specific seat (extra leg room, I'm 6' 6""). From LHR to ATH I logged on for check in as soon as it opened and there were only approx 13 other seats to select and from ATH to LHR approx 18 seats. Fortunately got an extra legroom seat on outbound but inbound had to ask an agent at the airport if a seat had become available. After a bit of tapping away she gave me extra legroom seats on both inbound flights (very appreciated). Please can we go back to selecting our own seats? Boarding is the usual chaos with no one taking any notice of the announcements (if they're boarding passengers seated at the back you can bet those with seats at the front will go through too) but it's no big deal and in no way reflects on the airline.

The space you have in this seat is limited the only plus is the leg room but people who try to go to the bathroom step into it hit your legs etc. Wondering why there is no Economy Plus as an option.,Passive
Travelled from Miami to London on January 8th 2015 in first class. Very bad service and very shabby cabin. Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.,Detractor
"Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was awful. In fairness, I should have done more research before buying the tickets. Our experience was Toronto to Dublin return. We flew from Toronto to Dublin on a red-eye flight, I can't comment on the experience too much as we were all asleep. The way back though was a nightmare. I was traveling by myself with our 2 year old daughter, and found out our plane from Dublin to Toronto was delayed by 2 hours when we got to the airport. I started to get worried though as we had a connecting flight in Toronto, and though the layover was 2.5 hours, 2 hours delay is starting to cut things close. After occupying ourselves for 5 hours at the airport (which was actually an amazing airport) we went to get on the plane to look forward to 7 hours of flying. As we boarded there was somebody on the flight not feeling well, and the plane (and everyone on board and with connecting flights) then waited for 30 more minutes to see if they were going to get better. So 2.5 hours late, 5.5 hours since getting to the airport, we take off. The staff were awful, no friendly service or smiles, and when I asked about what was going to happen to people with connecting flights, the attendant told me ""You'll have to ask once you get to the airport""! Even further, there were no apologies by the flight staff or pilots the whole flight about the delay, and almost everyone on board missed their connecting flights. The service was the exact opposite of what customer service is. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight, but we were the lucky ones. You have to download the Air Canada app to get any entertainment before you board, so 7 hours without any entertainment is more than you should ask of anyone. The only consolation was the food was pretty good and tasty.",Detractor
" Traveling from Paris to Thailand via Delhi, before getting onboard at Paris my wife was forced to write a form saying that she was not going to be more the one month in Thailand because of the fact that she only had a one way ticket and never the ground agent asked my wife anything about visa need it to travel to Thailand because of the fact the she is a Venezuela citizen and we were told that visa was no required because she was a US resident,. The three boarding passes were granted to her and then she boarded an Air India flight from Paris to Delhi, everything when fine until she landed at Delhi and was ready to take her flight from there to Bangkok where the ground personnel realized that my wife did not have a Thailand visa and after having the boarding passes in Paris by the Air India personnel access to board that flight was denied. The Thai Airways ground agent when the extra mile and try to help my wife in any possible matter but her hands where tied and nothing more couldn't been done, therefore the Thai personnel refer my wife back to the Air India agents and that's where our nightmare started. First of all the agent was very rude, my wife English is very limited and when I ask her to pass the phone to allow me to talk to him and see what our options were, after having a very un respectful conversation with the agent he toss the phone back to my wife and refuses to talk to me, another agent with a very kind attitude helped my wife, unfortunately the decision was made and my only option was to buy another business class ticket to my wife back to Paris. My wife was a victim of disrespectful treatment by Air India Ground agents I can not believe after you dropping the ball and not following standard operating procedures in Paris in order to review documents to full paying business class passengers we have to be liable of paying another business class ticket and even worst to pay for hotel accommodations. The following morning she was escorted from her room to the plane, forced to board last after everyone else were onboard, after arriving in Paris she had to wait until all passenger deplane in order to wait for the flight attendant who was holding her passport illegally retained.",Detractor
"Ethiopian Airlines has the worst Business Class experience. Old plane, with no personal TV screens, and of the two very small screens at front the plane, one was constantly flickering and the other was black and white. In addition the outlet for the headphones was not connecting properly so sounds was far from clear. Then the choice to play a subtitled Chinese movie was also an odd choice and hardly a new release, if one was able to see or hear the movie. As I went to charge my iphone was told that the power outlet at the seat was not working, then apparently there was not power at any seat. Food was unappetising. Although the staff were pleasant they were far from concerned about the lack of amenities or service in Business Class, and not able to offer any solutions, apart from more overheated food when the first dish was too terrible to consume. A definite no fly option if you want amenities and service in an airline.",Detractor
" I will never fly this airline again! Do your homework before you book, you will pay extra for everything! They do do not even offer a free non-alcoholic beverage! I had a a flight from Salt Lake City to Puerto Vallarta via Denver. When I went to pay for my luggage ahead of time, I realized that they do not offer any free bags including your carry on! I had to pay for my checked bag and my carry on for each flight. (So from Salt Lake to Denver I was charged and then from Denver to Mexico,) and the same on the way back. (I paid an extra $152 for one checked bag and one carry on bag). The next night when I went to check in 24 hours in advance, I found out that I also had to pay extra to choose a seat. Anywhere from $5 to $45 per flight. I chose a middle of the road seat. When I got on the plane the only seats that reclined at all were the most expensive seats! So unless you paid another $180 per person round trip you did not get a reclining seat. There was no in flight entertainment, there was not even a place to plug in your phone or device! There were plenty of other issues when I was trying to book the flights but I felt that people need to know about these the most. If I could say that I felt like I got a good deal and paid less for the flight than I would have with another airline, this may have been a better expereince but the only reason I went with them was because all of the flights with my usual airline were booked.",Detractor

We lucked out but I won't fly Spirit again! My daughter and I took a last-minute trip to Chicago from Minneapolis and decided to fly Spirit since we didn't need to take any bags-which would have almost made the price equal to a more reputable competitor! Our outgoing trip was on schedule and fine. Our return trip turned out OK but the mess at the airport made me realize that we were very lucky to get home only 30 minutes late! Every flight in the Spirit gate area was delayed or cancelled (one that was supposed to leave at 10.30am was finally cancelled at 7.30pm) and there was one poor gate agent who was trying her best to help and give information (information that she obviously wasn't getting from the company). People were screaming swearing etc at her and finally airport security had to come stand by her! There was no explanation for why flights were delayed or cancelled or why my flight which was scheduled to leave after most of the delayed flights was boarded and we left 30 minutes late! I won't take my chances again but happy that I won the Spirit lottery this time!,Detractor

Made several phone calls every day trying to track down our missing luggage. Call after call, lie after lie. Total disregard and lack of follow through. After day 6 I really started to panic when my husband received an email from Delta saying that our bags were delivered to us and the file was closed. No joke.

"Newark to Mumbai with Air India. The price of the ticket was quite good compared to other business class fares and it was for non stop both ways. $3890 vs almost $5800 for other one stop options. I did not expect a wide selection of western food nor entertainment. I was not wrong but what was available was adequate and I had movies etc on my iPad. I did not expect exceptional service. It was well below par of other airlines, but, it was not out of line with the value of the ticket or the non stop advantage. What got me was that so many of the seats did not work. Granted they all would be upright or completely flat. However, the foot rest did not work on any of the seats. Business class was only half full on the way out so I tried four different seats. Foot rest did not work on any of them. Not one seat was fully functional. The same was true on the return flight. I can put up with poor service and other things but a 15 hour flight needs a comfortable and functioning seat. Would I take them again? Yes, but the ticket price would have to be at least 50% less for the equivalent cabin on other airlines.",Detractor
"I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380. However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet. The best thing about the whole flight is that I only paid Â£340 including credit card charge booking fees so happy that I am now in Hong Kong and enjoying my break.",Passive

"Bangkok to Manchester via London. I used to fly BA on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering. More recently we've been using Emirates or Etihad. We travel the route two or three times a year to visit family. BA were offering a good price on their Premium Economy seats so we switched. What a big mistake. Never, ever again. Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a Â£40 - Â£50 surcharge. Reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. Leg room was OK but the seats were very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. Picture quality was like watching a TV in the 1950's. Food was appalling. Little choice, insipid starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil! If you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful. The plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places. Certainly on this route BA have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind Emirates and Etihad when it comes to comfort and service.",Detractor

" Chicago Midway to Newark. It is irritating when you travel with an airline 5 times and a flight gets canceled every. Single. I can understand the cancellations due to the weather. I can also understand the cancelations due to ""scheduled maintenance "" (badly scheduled if the plane was supposed to be flying though.) What I don't understand is how thinking that leaving your customers stranded overnight at the airport is ok. It is not. Allowing the customers to reschedule ""for free"" for a flight the airline canceled should not even be a question much less something that gets thrown in your face. No attempt or offer was made for a hotel or another place to spend the night. No offer or attempt was made to get us back into the same boarding position we had prior to our flight being canceled due to ""scheduled maintenance "" Delays are irritating but at least you get where you want to.

We flew Vancouver Canada (YVR) to Taipei Taiwan (TPE). This segment was in business class (Premium Laurel Class) on the 747-400. We had seats 7H and 7K. Boarding was fast and efficient. The seats were in the lower forward section of the 747 and were lie-flat angled seats. The service and food was very good. We pre-ordered our meals on-line. The IFE had a good selection of choices. This was my first experience with the angled seats and it was comfortable but I would opt for the 180 degree lie flat when given the choice. The flight arrived on time and our connection in Taipei was smooth we were greeted by name and shown where to go for our next flight. Our flight to Hong Kong (HKG) was on an MD-90 in seats 2A and 2C - Business Class. Service and meals were very good as well! Our return was slightly different flying from Bangkok Thailand (BKK) to TPE on an Airbus A330. Our seats (24F and 24G) were in economy on this flight and the service and seats were very good. My only complaint was that our seats were changed within 24 hours of our trip moving us away from friends we were seated next to. This also occurred on our next flight in business class but one person offered to switch seats once we were on the plane. Our flight from TPE to Los Angeles (LAX) was on the 777-300 ER in Royal Laurel Class - their newer designed business class seats - lie flat. We were in seats 5D and 5G aisle seats.

AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions. Landed early at ORD and quick disembarkation. Overall a good flight and cheap fare.,Promoter

"Booked an AC Vacations package and got rouged. I'm average size and had about 3"" of knee room. Seat was uncomfortable outgoing I had a knee massage from the tall man seated behind me who was clearly struggling in his seat. My partner was served cold coffee and got a shrug when we mentioned it. A women in the row ahead was served cold tea and the flight attended loudly blamed the passenger for putting milk in the tea. Late in the flight I happened to see a flight attendant racing through the cabin silently waving a water jug in front of her body.

CX881 LAX-HKG in Premium Economy. After a number of recent flights on US airlines it was a real pleasure to step on board a Cathay Pacific plane. The PE product is great for the long haul and worth the extra investment. Far superior to BA's equivalent. Only downside is getting out of your seat if you are at the window (or center) when the seats in front are reclined - makes for a difficult clamber over the person in the next seat. Great service - friendly sincere and efficient. The separate compartment on the 777 is a plus especially when sat on the right side making for easy access to the dedicated washroom.,Promoter
" I took a flight from Managua to Panama with Copa Airlines (CM) on 21/02/18 returning on 23/02/18. On the return i arrived at the airport nearly 3 hours before scheduled take off, but had to queue for 2 hours to get to the check in desk. At the desk the Copa operative told me i couldn't fly to Managua because i didn't have a yellow fever inoculation card. I wasn't warned about this when i booked the ticket on the website, and i wasn't warned about this when i checked in at Managua 2 days earlier. The first time that Copa decides to tell me i need a yellow fever inoculation card is when my flight is due to take off in 1 hour's time. The operative told me that it's my responsibility to ensure that i have the necessary documentation to travel. Later the same day i had a flight scheduled from Managua at 1.30pm to Houston USA and then a connecting flight to London UK. After much arguing i was issued a boarding pass as I â€œcould beâ€ in transit at Managua. In September the same year I had to make another journey to Panama, Tuesday 04/09/18 to Thursday 06/09/18. Aware that I needed a yellow fever inoculation card, I asked the CM check in staff at Managua Airport if this was still necessary for us to return to Managua in two days time. They said yes although for my wife, who is currently breast feeding, she is exempt from this. In Panama I paid 100 USD for a yellow fever inoculation. The following day I return to Panama airport to catch my plane to Managua and I'm told I can't have a boarding pass because my yellow fever card isn't 10 days old yet!! Again, no mention of this when I checked in at Managua Airport even when I specifically asked about the need for a yellow fever card. My wife and daughter flew to Managua without me and I spent a further 2 days in Panama before acquiring a letter from a doctor about my allergy to eggs thus making me exempt from the yellow fever card requirement. After returning to Managua I wrote a letter of complaint to CM demanding compensation as I believe CM are plainly negligent in this case. The reasonable person would say that the information that CMs employees used to deny me a boarding pass at Panama should have been provided to me by their employees at Managua two days earlier to prevent me from my financial loss. Especially given that I asked their employees at Managua if I would need a yellow fever inoculation card to return two days later. CM eventually acknowledged they are at fault. My claim was for 2 additional nights in a hotel and a partial loss of earnings on one day making a total of 394 USD. I believe my claim was entirely reasonable given the circumstances. However, CMs offer of compensation was for a travel certificate valid for 12 months worth 204USD. Given that I don't intend to fly with CM any time soon this offer of compensation is virtually worthless. If you are considering flying with Copa Airlines then please read clause 9.1.2.1.1 and 9.1.2.1.2 from the contract of carriage, because it basically says that even if their employees misinform you about your travel requirements it's your own responsibility anyway. In a recent email to me from Copa Airlines it starts:- â€œThank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is very important to us and helps us provide you with world class services.â€ I think more appropriate and honest would be:- â€œThank you for choosing Copa Airlines Your opinion is of no importance to us and we really couldn't care less about you.â€",Detractor

The flights were on time food was excellent (I'm a vegetarian) cabin crew were very polite and attentive to my needs.

"  Bassinets by British Airways cater for newborn only. My 10 month old son could not fit in it. The only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. The only option is to sleep on you. However the arm rests are fixed in and hard. Couple that with the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end. It was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from London to Hong Kong. Other airlines offer bassinets up to one years, some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours. Imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can't fit in the seat. And every so often you fear he'll fall off your lap. To travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it.",Detractor

Horrible customer service and lack of empathy for guests flying with them. Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40 to Georgia and was delayed until 1.11 pm. Around that boarding time the announcer made another call to let everyone know that the flight would further be delayed until around 4.30 pm due to the incoming aircraft having a cracked windshield. If they were aware of the situation beforehand why lie to the entire crowd of people waiting and expecting the initial delayed flight to depart at 1.11. To further add insult Frontier never offered any service recovery discounts fee waiver etc. Their guest service and accommodations are terrible. Many people were complaining to the staff that they were on a tight schedule for weddings birthdays etc and Frontier Airlines did nothing to help myself or those guests.

Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,Promoter

When we got off the aircraft and were directed to an information desk, which was crowded with people. It was a two hour wait before we got speaking to someone at this desk to be advised that we had to go to another information desk as they couldn't solve our issue. Eventually after 6 hours we were issued with our new flight details and told we would be given accommodation as the next flight out was 7.40pm the following evening. We had to wait a further hour for a bus to cobring us to hotel Novotel. Arriving at the hotel we were escorted by security and had to wait another hour to be given key cards and directed to our rooms. As a smoker we came back out of our rooms to see where we could go and advised by security that we were not allowed leave, checking the main hall door finding it was locked and then to be advised to smoke in the bathroom of our rooms with no smoking signs everywhere! Fire safety practices reduced to zero at this hotel! Next morning we were escorted to a hall down stairs for breakfast and later, lunch. Breakfast was a slice of ham and cheese with stale bread, lunch was cold. The treatment we received was awful and disrespectful.

I was told the only other available flight on any airline would be at 11.30am. I was told I couldn't be put on a wait list but I could standby for an earlier flight. So I arrived early only to discover that I could have been put on a standby list. I did not get on the earlier flights because so many others were already on the standby list and the 11.30 was nearly an hour late. I had to check my bag at the gate (not for gate pickup though) because, even though I am a relatively frequent flyer, had been delayed 5 hours, I was given last boarding priority. I am a patient person, but the complete lack of empathy about a situation that was causing a hardship really needs attention.

" Hong Kong to Brisbane. This is my third flight with Qantas in the past 12 months and each departure has been delayed: the first time for 5Â½ hours departing Brisbane, second time for 1 hour departing Los Angeles and now this current flight Hong Kong to Brisbane delayed for 55 mins. Qantas is no longer the â€˜pride of Australia'. It is now Jetstar with the flying kangaroo on its tail. Over the past few years, Qantas has become a very poor relative to this once great airline. It is now no more than a low-budget airline that charges full-service fares. What a joke!!! I know Alan Joyce has brought the airline from the brink of bankruptcy to being â€˜in the black' financially but at what cost to passenger loyalty? In fact, after this flight, I will never ever fly Qantas again. There are far, far better quality international airlines than Qantas to choose from that take pride in providing service excellence to their passengers. As for meals and amenities! It was about 9.30pm (approx 1Â½hrs after take-off) before the meals and drinks cart came around. Why do passengers now have to wait until meal time before the drinks trolley comes around? I'm not a big drinker but a nice refreshment once up in the air would have been very welcome. The menu had a choice of 3 main meals, a vegetable with rice, a chicken casserole with mashed potato, beans and carrot (my choice) and a fish with rice. My meal was tasty but very, very small. This came with a small mousse as dessert, a small bread roll and a choice of an alcoholic beverage. No further alcohol was served. Gone are the days where a good sized food tray came with entrÃ©e, main, dessert, fruit and cheese and biscuits. No snacks, not even a small bag of nuts, were served at all during the flight though the menu did state that fruit would be served mid-flight",Detractor

The A330 was quite new and comfortable. The screen for the IFE is large and has plenty of movies and programmes available. Two options were available for meals and in both journeys, I got my choice of meal despite sitting in the last row. I opted for the red chicken curry for the outgoing flight and stir fried pork with fried rice for the return flight. Both delicious and portions adequate. Although the seats were in the last row, they were able to recline with some room to spare before hitting the wall. The toilets were near the last row of seats but they were positioned further back, toward the galley area. Cabin crew worked hard on this 2 hour flight with hot towels given at the beginning of the flight and a meal service with coffee/tea run after the meal. One thing useful is the foot pedal that is attached to the toilet trashbins. This is a feature I have not seen on some new planes of other airlines. Toilets were well stocked.",Promoter

" Bologna to Stansted. A truly dreadful experience with Ryanair. Just 15 minutes prior to take off, having checked in etc., flight was cancelled (along with a number of other Ryanair flights) because of heavy rain - funny thing was, every other airline was continuing to fly, there were no other cancellations. There were no Ryanair staff in the airport to help or advise - check-in was being handled by other (I presume airport) staff. So, because of the sudden number of Ryanair cancellations all happening at the same time, that meant there was something like 1000 people all queuing to speak to three, non-Ryanair, staff at the information desk.

" Paid full Latitude fare for a flight pass ticket from MIA to YYZ recently. Overall a tragically disappointing product from AC. Everything from the check-in experience to cabin cleanliness to food quality was disappointing. They are using the tired old B767s on the Rouge routes. Premium Economy seats look like hand-me downs from another airline - Rouge hasn't been flying long enough to see so much wear. Overhead bin space is ultra-tight. One the whole bin in row 1 is unavailable causing a ripple effect down the aisle. MIA always closes the J security checkpoint at night. The remaining one at H has no TSA Precheck line, no premium line, and there are some very large flights going to South America at this time from the same area. Result is a massive pileup at security with no way out. I asked the check-in staff about this, and they were utterly apathetic. There's a new policy that cabin bags need a security tag from the airline. They don't tell you this, so if you checked in online, and wait in the security line, you get sent back to get tags from the airline. How about an email notification in advance? Food in Rouge Premium was mediocre. The IFE selection was disappointing and annoying because you needed to have an iPad on your lap, or the tray out all the time.

LHR-MAD flight was mediocre and the attitude of the crew left a lot to be desired, particularly their attitude to safety. MAD-VLC was delayed by 30 minutes with no information given (at one point, gate stuff packed up and left) which meant we arrived too late for our car hire. Inbound VLC-MAD flight was delayed due to weather, and later air traffic control. When enquiring about our connection, the gate staff at VLC refused to do anything and informed that everything had to be done in Madrid. We called the helpline and were told that nothing can be done to rebook onto a later flight either. VLC-MAD in Business Class had no service, the seat-belt sign was left switched on for the whole flight. With the seats on the CRJ 1000 being the same as economy there was no point paying extra. Upon landing in Madrid, nobody was there to meet our flight. We approached the customer service agent in the T4S lounge and were told they could find no seat for us (economy or business) until the next day. We found seats on Iberia Express but the agents maintained that they could see no availability. We then had no choice but to pay for the seats on Iberia Express in cash just to come home that day and throw away our business class Iberia flight home which we had missed. We were told when we called the call centre that the back office would have arranged us a new flight already knowing we'd miss our connection - obviously, this wasn't the case. We made it in time for the MAD-LHR flight, but because assistance was not given upon landin- we did not make it in time to the plane.",Detractor
" Chisinau to Moscow. Aeroflot is improving daily its service. Due to the lack of the sky-bridge, business class passengers, SkyTeam Elite and Elite Premium got a dedicated mini-bus to ensure fast and priority boarding. A 2 year old 320 with business class configured in 2-2 and economy in 3-3. Food service wasn't the best - sandwiches and a good variety of soft drinks, including juices. It wasn't the best sandwich I had, but still a good snack for a 2h 45min flight. Chairs were comfortable, with generous legroom, covered in a blue leather-like material. A pleasant surprise were European style and USB plug-ins. There wasn't the traditional in-flight entertainment system, however Aeroflot is implementing a new free on-board system. Having an Android, iOS or Windows compatible device, I had access to Russian or foreign films, cartoons, music videos, documentaries and an interactive map, showing traditional details like altitude, speed, time and so on. They also had a designated area with information regarding transit procedures, company's history. Overall is was a night flight, very calm and nothing extraordinary.",Promoter
"We flew Economy from SeaTac to Narita in October 2012 on the 787 and the flight seating was comfortable enough. The in-flight entertainment was excellent and the food & service very good. This year we took the same ANA Economy flight from SeaTac to Narita in October 2013 and the flight seating was terrible. In the past year ANA has changed the main Economy seating configuration from 2-3-2 to 3-3-3 and reduced the amount of space between seat rows to squeeze in more ""sardines into the same can"". It is so tight that the person directly in front has to move their seat to the upright position to adequately allow the food trays to fit onto the very small fold out tray. As well the newly instituted one (1) suitcase rule is very inadequate for those of us going for extended trips. Since the return flight home was re-directed to Portland OR due to ""fog/visibility problems"" at SeaTac and a series of subsequent problems our flight finally arrived ~8 hours late and this afforded an opportunity to speak with many other passengers. I found that many/most other passengers in the Economy cabin were of the same general opinion and would now strongly consider other options for their next trip. Options including flying to SF or Vancouver to get a more comfortable flight. ANA had a good product and through these changes of seat configuration has now given other carriers offering direct flights to Japan an excellent opportunity to compete and beat. We are now ""in-play"" and will not take another ANA flight to Japan w/o first understanding more about the seating arrangement. We did try to upgrade in Narita to Premium Economy but were allowed to do that",Detractor
"We had a good flight with Cathay Pacific Airways. I'm tall (1.78cm) so the extra space in Premium Economy was more than enough for me. Good entertainment options. The only thing that was so-so is that the food is the same as an economy class - so just average airline food on a plastic tray. Also, premium economy shares the same toilets with economy class. The cabin staff was alright.",Promoter
Flew from Cairns to Melb on a weekday flight which was completely full. The flight was 15 mins late departing but arrived in MEL on time. The crew were friendly and attentive and provided very good service throughout. This looked like a fairly new 737-800 and the quality of the in-flight entertainment and the viewing screen was excellent. As for the meal this was a really pleasant surprise consisting of a nice Moroccan lamb dish followed later by an ice cream. Qantas gets its share of knockers but this flight was certainly up there with the best of any domestic service.,Promoter
"  Miami to Toronto. This is the last Rouge flight I will be taking. Unfortunately, as Air Canada expands its Rouge line and destinations this will likely mean simply switching airlines for many flights. Although flying Air Canada has never been cheap, one of the things they always had going for them was that the leg room and comfort of the economy cabin was a step above many US and European airlines. Not so with Rouge! This is the most cramped cabin I have travelled in. 3+ hours of having my legs firmly pressed into the seat in front of me is uncomfortable and unacceptable. Rouge was a big mistake for Air Canada. This is Air Canada's 80th year of service and they are trying to expand their international presence.",Detractor
"First time travelling in a premium class so compared with Economy it was great. Check-in at LHR was quick and we were grateful of the additional baggage allowance in Club Europe. The fast track through security was also welcome. The Galleries Lounge in T3 was excellent, we were welcomed and given a quick overview of the lounge. The breakfast in the lounge offered everything from cereal to pastries to hot sandwiches, as well as tea, coffee, juice, water and a wide selection of alcohol. There was also a great view of the runway which my son enjoyed. The service on board the flight itself offered hot towels prior to take off, then a full English Breakfast with real cutlery and plates, warm bread rolls and choice of drinks. The legroom was excellent and the seat was comfortable. They are laid out in the same 3x3 configuration as Economy but the middle seat has a table over it which gives you extra room to place your items. As you are near the front of the plane, disembarkation was quick and we were at the carousel before our cases. The return journey was much the same, and although the lounge at BCN did not offer anywhere near such a good selection of food, the seating was far superior to LHR. The meal on the way back was a selection of Spanish meats with, cheese, olives and a spicy mousse, together with the usual selection of drinks. We were able to use the Fast Track through passport control at LHR which avoided a long queue and meant we were out of the airport and in our car within an hour. Overall this was a fantastic experience for me and my family who usually travel in Economy.",Promoter

" Amsterdam to New Delhi via Kyiev. When I arrived at check-in in Amsterdam they told me the flight was delayed, however, it was not delayed and passengers boarded on time. I was not given any option or information about food or meals. However, when a free meal was served to all the passengers on the plane, I was the only person who was charged ten Euros by the hostess. Later I was notified that my meal should also have been free of charge. When I complained about this to the hostess, an on-board policeman was called and I was told to sit down and shut up! The plane was an old Indonesian / Malaysian carrier from the 80s. There was one tv screen and an old 80s romantic movie was shown with terrible graphics. No passengers seemed to watch the movie as it was so poor quality, on the return journey the movie was in Hindi, nobody could understand and again nobody watched it. The hostesses only focused on taking care of business class passengers, economy class was mayhem while business class was peaceful and dimly lit. It was not possible to take a nap in economy class due to the bright lights, noise and commotion. I have complained to several staff at UIA about being charged for a meal which was included in my ticket fee, however, nobody proved adequate to handle such a complaint and simply replied 'oh sorry sir, you should not have been charged for your meal'. No mention of a refund or what action will be taken! On the return journey passengers boarded and sat on the aeroplane for two hours before any drinks or refreshments were offered and served. Passengers were hot, sweaty and frustrated. Overall an overpriced budget airline, uncomfortable seating, noisy plane, poor in-flight entertainment and poor, dishonest staff.",Detractor
"  First time to fly with this Airline, and I swear it will also my last. My inbound flight to LAX from AUH had no issue.

And the worst of all - the check in process from Abu Dhabi to Riyadh, it's highly disorganized, first time I've seen such check-in chaos in my more than 20 years of air travels.

The airplane broke down before the scheduled departure the mechanic was not available I missed my connection in Denver and have been here for the last 24-27 hours.

LHR-LIN and MXP-NRT in economy. Flight from LHR on time to Milan Linate. Very clean comfortable A320 with nice leather seats seatback LCD but no snacks. Overall Altialia's short haul service was a welcome surprise however I was disappointed that no drinks/meal service was provided. Return flight was similar and on time into LHR. MXP-NRT was my first long haul with Alitalia onboard 777. Very pleasant and professional welcome onboard however the cabin outbound to Tokyo was not cleaned sufficiently and found crumbs under my seat. Seatback IFE displays were small but provided an interactive movie/music/games/ menu seats also provided with AZ embroidered pillow blanket and headphones. Only problems I encountered with my seat was inadequate legroom due to the IFE box under my seat A and a scratched window on both flights. Catering onboard was fantastic and found the crew on both sectors hard working 2 main meals snacks on both occasions and a continuous drinks service. Choice of meals onboard was an expected Japanese or Italian. For a 12 hour flight I felt comfortable and well looked after by the crew. Both flights on time.,Promoter

"  SÃ£o Paulo to Geneva via Casablanca. Overall, I was positively surprised. Boeing 787 is an incredible airplane, and very quiet, which helps out with sleeping. Seating is spacious and there is lots of leg room and space in the overhead compartments. Check-in and boarding in Sao Paulo were comparable to any other airline and staff quite helpful. There was a line in the accommodation desk of RAM in Casablanca but it moved quickly, and I was put in a very nice hotel during my 15 hour layover, with dinner and breakfast included. My bags arrived normally in Geneva. No delays in any two flights. Problems with RAM though: the food is horrible, especially on the longer flight. Although the flavor was okay, it was very poorly presented, overall low quality, and not something you would expect at an airline. No alcoholic drinks on board, no snacks or extra beverages in between meals. Staff in the longer flight seemed impatient and not very willing to help. Bathroom was a bit dirty as well. On the shorter flight food was a bit better but still poorly presented. Staff was a lot more professional. My ticket was not cheap at all. I think overall the service of RAM was acceptable, but the food was a low point and reason enough for me not to fly with them again until I hear that has improved.",Passive
" Toronto to Vancouver. First of all, our flight from Vancouver on Dec 23, 2017 was cancelled and we were never notified by Air Canada. We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldn't make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldn't suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after.

Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal.

From what I've read, most Spirit customers rate this airline poorly due to ""surprise"" baggage rates or lack of inflight accommodations. Extra baggage rates are hardly a surprise. Every booking site (Expedia, Cheapair.. etc.) I visited clearly states that baggage fees may apply. You do have to pay for refreshments and snacks (just another cost that's included in other airline tickets). My flight was only about an hour long. No need for a snack or refreshment. I already had a bottle of water and ate at the airport. You get what you pay for, a flight from point A to B, simple as that. The plane itself was just like any other plane.

If booked in advanced fares are normally affordable.,Passive

"  Los Angeles to Berlin via Keflavik. Our group of 7, including 2 seniors, 2 adults, and 3 children from LAX to Berlin this past week. All I can is that for the price, WOW air is a wow in my book. The only issue we had is that in Iceland our baggage was held because our layover was less than 24 hours. This was clearly stated on the WOW FAQ, but we missed it. As long as you know what to expect, there is no better value than WOW. The food on board is no more expensive than food we have purchased on US Domestic airlines, and was better quality. The only negative is that they can run out of things sometimes. The legroom was excellent and the seats were comfortable, but not luxurious. The aircraft was very clean and well taken care of. The in flight crew were excellent and very nice. No issues what so ever. For us the next best price for LAX to Berlin was $300 more per person flying Aeroflot with a layover in Moscow. For the extra $2100 it would have cost, we paid for our lodging and food for a week in Germany and still had money left to buy food to take on the plane. Advice: As long as you know what to expect you will be very happy. Make sure to read all of WOW's FAQ's and you will be prepared.",Promoter

Checked in early for my flight at Vnukovo Airport. Good advice from the Turkish Airlines Office about changing my second flight. First flight took off and landed on time. A good meal was served shortly after takeoff. The second flight was going to be late (notified when checking in) and was even later. I was asleep before the flight took off and when I woke up later I was served dinner - it was sub standard for a business class meal. Luggage came off relatively early but my suitcase was wet and some of the contents were also wet (I managed to get things dry that day in Kathmandu). Ticket was purchased through a travel company at a heavily discounted rate. There was a small charge to change the date of my second flight but the advice received in Moscow was good and fair.,Passive
"Spirit is mercenary and anything but a bargain.

Not a bargain at all! I could have flown a ""real"" airline that doesn't charge extra for everything including water!

I am a 6.10ft tall, 70 year old senior. Delta switched the aircraft (Boeing 757 N552NW had a diferent configuration from the plane originally assigned for this leg, with fewer comfort seats) and no one warned me. As I got in I asked for assistance from the steward in attendance. He answered he had nothing to do with that adding he would have to be better paid by Delta to deal with such matters. Delta didn't warn me of the change in the seating category and the employee treated me with disrespect. I tried talking to the cabin chief and she offered me a glass of wine to solve the situation, which I refused. I was obliged to travel in a terrible situation.",Detractor
QR 957 on Jan 9th and QR 956 on Feb 1st. CGK-DOH-CGK Business A330. First and last time. These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space and the midsection goes up. This gets you in a totally unnatural position. Their product on 380 and 777 is better but avoid the 330 at any cost. Just buy and economy seat or fly another airline who better understood the needs of BC travellers.,Detractor

Just returned to Australia after flights booked through Finnair. Overall not really impressed with the service. A change in our itinerary was our first upset-we never really got an explanation as to why. On our outward flight we sat on the plane for an hour whilst baggage was being loaded. The aircon wasn't functioning so we sat sweating for an hour. Cabin service was quite poor just above a budget airline standard. We asked if we might have a drink and were brushed off and remained thirsty. During long legs the flight attendants were rarely seen outside of meal service. Overall not an airline I would rush to travel with again.,Passive

He had to board the plane to prove him wrong. I hate this airline, they are garbage. Also the smallest seats and legroom of all of them.",Detractor
" I have flown Aer Lingus 6 times this month after deciding to take advantage of their non-stop flight from Hartford to Dublin. The convenience is great, and Dublin is an ideal airport for connections. I fly over 150,000 miles per year, and have experienced all of the major airlines. I am shocked to see Aer Lingus highly rated. This airline quality on all 6 of my flights this month was below all of the major airlines and on-par with lower tier airlines like Air Europa. Even though I had a 3 hour layover in Dublin, they lost my luggage. The customer service related to lost luggage was the worst I have seen, and the staff immediately came out and said ""don't expect to see your luggage this trip"". They could not provide any information, and simply seemed not to care. The seats are extremely uncomfortable on the transatlantic flight. The 757 is old, and the seats extremely hard. It is an extreme problem being a vegetarian on this airline. The vegetarian option is horrible, and I have had the same meal for my flights and snacks. The website is the worst I have used. They do not allow you to change seats online. I broke a rib, and wanted to change to an aisle seat, but this could not be done. I was told to talk to people at the gate, and it could not be done at that point. Frequent Flyer program is horrible. I have flown 6 times across the Atlantic in the psat 2 months, and I am no where near Silver. Their program is much worse than competitors. No drinks, water or coffee are provided on the Inter-Europe flights. Asking for a cup of coffee during the trans Atlantic flight is like asking the flight attendant to move to first class. Service is below the standard on other airlines. Dublin is ideal for transfers. Able to clear customs prior to the trip. No Wifi (even for purchase on long haul flights).

The main course of the dinner was dry and the bread was stale, but the red wine was good, plus we were given real cutlery and not plastic.

Flight attendants were friendly, efficient and competent. My biggest complaint is that the in-flight entertainment system was broken for the entire 10-hour flightâ€”luckily I had plenty of books but I would have preferred a couple of movies to pass the time.

LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines.

When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,Detractor

After being lied to several times by the airline with what would be a reasonable request I highly recommend taking another airline. In terms of feedback and dispute resolution.

"Milano to Erbil via Vienna with Austrian Airlines regularly over the last 4 years. The short Milano-Vienna flight is usually fine. Vienna-Erbil is a 3.5 hours flight. Over the years I have experienced nearly empty flights and fully booked ones and the cabin service is typically consistent. The real problem is the non-existent inflight entertainment. Their A320 offer no individual TV screens. Overhead small screens every 4 rows were available up to a couple of years ago, but these are always kept closed in recent times - not even showing the old cartoons and gags or flight information. Not a single sheet with sudoku or crosswords is distributed - sometimes there aren't even newspapers available when boarding or they are in German only, which is silly when most passengers are non-German speakers (Austrian is one of the only European airlines connecting Erbil with a daily flight). The meal is not bad but small in size and no choice is offered. The dessert is the same for 4 years. The main dish of baked pasta has been the same for the past 2 years. I like it, but many passengers can't really eat it because of its unbelievably high garlic content. I can't say much about the cabin crew as after serving meal and coffee, efficiently but without smiles, they simply disappear for the next 2 hours. As a comparison, the daily flight from Istanbul operated by Turkish Airlines offers (in economy class to the same destination, for a shorter flight) the choice among two menus, pillows and blankets, and an individual PTV screen with a broad range of movies, hundreds of music albums and some simple video games.",Detractor

Plane was acceptable and comparable to the other airlines we had used however the service was worse. The crew seemed uninterested the food was nothing special and beverages extremely limited and served out of sync with food. Beijing to Sydney on a Boeing 777-300. The plane was ok but service identical to the one we had between Stockholm and Beijing. Very disappointing. On return a Boeing 777-300 from Sydney to Beijing. The experience was repeated. Service was very disappointing and beverages served late and very limited except for water. Beijing to Stockholm an Airbus A330. Legroom was more limited than the former A330 and selection of audio/video very limited. Service was somewhat better and beverages was served right after food however very limited. On the positive side was the opportunity to use the Air China transit lounge however this did not compensate for the low quality service.

"  London Heathrow to Denpasar via Jakarta. Garuda Indonesia offer a generous 30kg allowance in Economy class and check in online was a breeze. Slightly disappointed by the wait to drop off bags and the staff where not forthcoming with calling people across but this is not down to the airline but their handling agents at Heathrow. Onboard (boarding starting a good 60 mins before departure) we were welcomed warmly by the Purser and Senior Crew. Luckily it wasn't full I'd guess at best a 75% load in Economy (Business was half full and First Class empty) we had three seats to ourselves. Once in the air the IFE kicked in, while not as slick as EK or QR it had an ample selection for the next 15 hours. The crew offered dinner, either a western choice or Indonesian which unfortunately had run out by the time it got to us, the dinner was a bit meh but filled a gap none the less. On collecting trays a second drinks run was offered but the crew where somewhat shocked when I asked for a G&T (why offer Gin in Economy if you have to get the atomic from Business Class) lights out for the next 6 or so hours. Just off the coast of Eastern India Breakfast was offered, this time the Indonesian option was available and it was really good! The lights where dimmed again for the last few hours, however the crew passed around a warm wrap 45 mins before landing which was a nice touch. 35mins late into CGK and a long drive to T2 to clear customs and immigration then back on a bus to T3 to clear Security and go through the Boarding Gate to DPS (I think 90% of the passengers were connecting to the same quick connection flight). Leg room on the connecting A330-300 was just as good as the Boeing 777, however we departed 45mins late to wait for everyone on the late LHR flight. Again a warm meal was on offer from CGK, the main was very good, the desert was not to my liking or many others around.

" Atlanta to Lagos via Amsterdam. Issue started from ATL airport. My flight was originally meant to leave at about 8:25 pm today but because they overbooked people on this flight they downgraded me to economy class without my knowledge. I complained to the agent about my seat not being what I booked and paid for. They made me leave that airplane to sort out the issue all by myself. I spoke to one of the KLM agents and showed her my itinerary at the airport gate - who told me they were overbooked while another agent rebooked me on a business seat on another flight leaving tonight at 10:30pm after so much confusion and frustration. I called the customer service number and the Lady was nice but on getting to the lady supervisor on the phone with a three way call, she was rude, insensitive, inhumane to my plight for help after I and my wife explained the situation to her. All she kept saying was my flight was not confirmed and she can not help me even after the gate KLM agent told me it was due to overbooked flight. She went on to say the flight the KLM airport agent gave me would not work because she can not see it on the computer and she refused to talk to the airport agent at any time to resolve the issue after explaining to her the need to...so they could discuss their findings on their individual klm computers. My question to KLM corporate is why do some KLM clients have to go through so much stress and why did they choose me to be downgraded, inconvenienced and embarrassed? I would have appreciated if someone explained to me honestly what was going on instead of some KLM staff especially the supervisor being so so so nonchalant about the situation. However, I would like to commend the last KLM customer service rep my wife spoke to tonight on the phone. He was empathetic and understanding. I am really disappointed with the lady supervisor who did not make any attempt to understand the issue, not to talk about even resolving the issue. I am really disappointed with KLM as a whole and some agents do need to be retrained in dealing with issues at hand.

Several of us were late by minutes to connecting flights to Europe, after being encouraged to run to catch our connections, all flights left without the 15-20 of us. These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible, let us know and give us options, at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line.",Detractor

I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffÃ¨t of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude.

We have traveled twice in the last two months on this airline and found the service to be extremely slow the food awful. On our last trip we were in the air for over 6 hrs and I turned on my overhead light for service (another drink) only had one to that point as that was all that offered up till then. To be told we would be landing in 1 hr and I could wait till then and could my drinks for free at the resort. Very rude comment and also we were only landing to drop off people at Punta Cana and still had approx. another 3 hrs of air time. All four trips (2 to point of destination and 2 return) they had run out of tomato juice before they had got to our row 11. The movies were bad and then to have to watch 3 same re-runs of a sitcom after - that's bad. Both trips we thought were direct flights and only found out after we paid that there were stoppages on all. Not to mention delays at airports or on runway. Always was something going wrong!,Detractor

"If you are flying somewhere with connecting flights, this is not the airline for you. I paid $525 dollars to get from Gainesville, Florida to Maruqette, Michigan. I got delayed in Charlotte two times to Chicago and then both flights got cancelled. I ended up getting to Chicago past midnight where I had to sit in the airport until 3 AM where I asked to speak to a supervisor. It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me."" Then she rudely told me, ""I'm going to direct you to the line behind you to speak to a customer representative."" After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination. This airline does not care about their customers and will do as least as possible for you. I spoke to four different supervisors at three different airports and only one was kind and tried to help me. Do not fly this airline if you can help it because I never will again.",Detractor
Flew Vueling Airlines from Athens to Barcelona and found it to be a pretty nice airline. Ticket price was very competitive. Both flights departed on time.

We flew Toronto to Dublin when booking the flight it was simply Air Canada it wasn't until we were boarding we saw the air hostesses wearing those ridiculous trilby hats that I realised something wasn't quite right. Safe to say the worst flight I have been on. Very unprofessional staff the food was cold and horrible. Neither me nor my boyfriend ate it. The planes are very cramped and the seats are terribly uncomfortable. I definitely would not recommend them for a long haul flight. I paid $1200 to be squished in a seat for almost 8 hours with a rented tablet and a headphone dock that didn't work. Also when you usually travel with any airline you expect a certain level of professionalism in how the staff not only act but how they dress Air Canada Rouge staff look very scruffy. Shirts untucked unbuttoned as I said ridiculous hats just not what you would usually expect-but maybe that last part is just me!,Detractor
" Berlin to Hong Kong via Copenhagen / Stockholm. I was flying economy and was able to get an update at the gate for premium economy for a really good deal. The downside was that i have paid for my seat in economy and I didn't get any compensation for that. I have flown SAS before, in premium economy as well and I must say, the overall impression is the same. They don't excel in anything, I don't remember a part of the journey that made me say ""wow"" but also they aren't bad in anything. You get a relatively okayish experience for an okayish amount of money. The new things in premium economy this time were: free Wifi on board and the possibility of using the lounge at ARN. About the lounge in review separately. The inconvenience here was that making the upgrade at the gate, I had to go back through passport control, walk some good steps and then go back through passport and security control to get back to the gate. I ended up 15 minutes in the lounge. And also, I had to ask them at the gate if I was able to use the lounge, they didn't tell me when I did the upgrade. Because it was new, I had to see it. The seat I got was indeed huge, although not as comfortable as expected. I was alone on the whole row and the cabin, even with so many upgrades was still empty. The food was average, not what you would expect from a premium cabin and the service was in the same line. I couldn't log in automatically with my e-ticket number so I had to ask the crew to provide me a voucher in order to access the Wifi. It was unlimited, but I couldn't browse the internet, it worked just for social apps, so it was a nice plus, anyway. The seats had plugs for charging devices. The flights were almost all on time, only when coming back the delay made it impossible to make my 30 minutes connections, but I was rescheduled and got in TXL at the same time. Landing in HKG was 45 minutes ahead of schedule. As an airline, better than average, premium economy not.",Passive
"  When we checked in, we only recieved our boarding passes from Honolulu to Dallas. Seat on the Boeing 767 was poor, I am a skinny person, and the seat and legroom was horrible for a 7 hour flight. The food was ok, I had a salad for 12 bucks. When we landed in Dallas, we tried to go to a kiosk in the airside, where you can print a boarding pass you didn't recieve at check-in, or so it said. We weren't able to print the boarding pass because American and US Airways were still in the process of merging, but both planes were painted in the American Airlines livery. When we went to the gate, luckily DFW Airport has the sky train, that's a plus, the gate agent refused to give us our boarding pass, so I had to show him the confirmation e-mail. We were the last passengers onboard, there was no overhead baggage space, so we had to go back to the gate agent to have our bags gate checked to Philly. Luckily, I slept throughout this entire flight. Landed in Philly, everything was ok, got our checked bags, and left. Never again will fly on American.",Detractor

"Las Vegas to Sydney via Los Angeles, and American Airlines are by far the worst airline I have travelled. Not only did they delay our flight by 2 hours resulting in a plane full of people missing their connect from LAX to Australia, but they were completely unhelpful with the reorganisation of all of the missed flights. We waited from 10:30pm - 3:00am to have our flight rescheduled (which left over 24 hours after our original flight) and have accommodation organised. We arrived at our accommodation to find that American Airlines credit card declined 4 times. We were then asked if we would go to a new hotel at 2:30am which required us to use a shuttle that left every 20 min to go back to the airport and then go on a 2nd 20min shuttle to go to the new hotel. It is currently 3:30am and they are yet to provide a credit card that has been accepted for a $115 payment. They also provided a $7 food voucher. All of that aside, we were treated so poorly by each of the American air staff we encounted and I really couldn't speak more poorly of any airline travel situation. Bitterly disappointed.",Detractor

"CDG-KL travelled long haul with Air France for the first time. Had heard that the Premium Economy seats were uncomfortable but that turned out to be an understatement. They were as hard as park benches. I had to resort to scrounging cushions from other seats to sit on - not worth the price premium. Leg room was OK and could extend my legs fully under seat in front (I'm 62""). The food was OK but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food but rather had to be requested at the same time. Took a good 45 minutes for them to come and clear away the plates with all the attendant issues of having it left there on the tray. No offers of digestif despite being listed on the menu. During the cabin darkness period was not approached a single time to be offered a drink hot flannel etc. The only time I saw crew during this time was when I got up to walk front to back of the plane and discovered a couple of them in the galley reading magazines. All in all doesn't come anywhere near Emirates or Singapore so would actively look to avoid in future for long haul.",Passive
Delta 2366 JFK to MSP. Delayed for broken plane - we were in line to take off when they decided a broken panel light warranted fixing.

"  Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€ or â€œnew versionâ€ I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn't have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there's no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.",Detractor

On nearly every sector they locked off one of the toilets and this made it difficult as all flights were full.

Complimentary wine was good. They played one in flight family friendly movie each way. No Complaints whatsoever will fly Sunwing again.,Promoter

I've flown with Cathay a few times. Recently did SYD-HKG-LHR and return 9 days later (yesterday). I enjoyed my trip and was pleasantly surprised with the food this time more than any other. Seats are a bit comfier with Emirates but for the price being just slightly above the cheapest available I would choose Cathay if on a budget. If I had a bit more money I would prefer Emirates. Staff were very helpful and friendly.,Promoter
RIX-AMS. Completely inadequate experience and will never use this airline again. In Amsterdam there was a massive queue - I arrived 2 hours in advance but despite that I noticed everything was moving so slowly at the airport simply because not enough desks were open. Being concerned about missing my flight I walked up to the desk indicating I was worried to miss my flight and was told not to worry. When it was finally my turn to check in I was told I was too late for check in and they cancelled my ticket. When confronting them with the situation that I was assured not to worry they started laughing and was also told that they would not reimburse the money - ended up flying Lufthansa instead.,Detractor
"I recently flew from Miami to London. Sat in the economy class. Seat was extremely narrow designed for very slim person. I am 185lbs and 5'11"". For me the seat was very uncomfortable. If you are a large person recommend to buy 2 seats or avoid flying economy. The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry. This airline lowered their standards tremendously. I used 50000 points and paid $68 for this one way flight. In monetary terms approx $700. If the airlines do not stop abusing their passenger I personally will give up long distance flying.",Detractor
" This flight was completely canceled due to ""high winds."" I have lived in ABQ for 29 years and in all my traveling experiences this has never happened. When I called customer service they said oh no problem we are putting you on the next flight to Seattle then to Portland which made me think okay I still have a shot. Nope it was canceled already but their system wasn't updated and by the time I called again all the flights were booked and they were unwilling to put me on another airline even though the Alaska Airlines staff at the airport had at first been doing that for other passengers. This trip had been planned for months and I ended up having to cancel everything because of ""high wind"" when other planes were landing just fine and a poor customer service who booked me on another canceled flight. Highly disappointing.",Detractor
"  Melbourne to Las Vegas via Los Angeles. All things considered, United offer a good business class service for this long-haul flight. Plane left on time and food served promptly after departure. Food quality was fairly good. Movies and IFE were also good. Service was prompt and attentive. Seat reclines flat and allows you to get a good sleep. In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told ""We're out of nuts."" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern. Possibly not as overly comfortable as some other airlines, though I slept very well on the way back. Wifi was good, when it worked! I have to say that I was generally happy overall. For a business class traveler on business, it did exactly what it needed to do.",Passive
" Newark to Singapore via Beijing. This was a business trip. Picked air china because of the timing/schedule of dates worked well with my needs and it was very cheap. My trip was all business class from Newark to Singapore via Beijing. Outbound My flight had a long long layover to begin with, on my way to the airport my travel called me and informed me that my connection flight in Beijing departure time was changed by 6 hours later! Worst layover of my life! Service was ok on the flight, food so so. Entertainment selection for western audience is minimal. Seats are ok as far as incline etc. The lounge was packed and chairs were not comfortable for long haul seating. Food tasted like mediocre Chinese restaurant food. After 48 hours of ordeal I got to Singapore 6 hours late. Return flight supposed to leave at 11:30 at night was delayed by 3 hours and I had a connection in Beijing leaving me just an hour to connect! While waiting in the lounge I got a call from Air china that they booked me on an earlier Singapore airline flight (only best thing the did!) in order to make the connection. what a difference of service in Singapore air! Made it to Newark and my luggage didn't after all this. Lessons learned - you get what you pay for. Expected Air china to be a flagship airline with China being a global power, but not so.

Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.,Promoter

We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have lay flat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs.,Detractor

" My flight to Bangkok did not start well. Ground staff were rather unfriendly, but what followed was simply unbelievable. After we boarded the plane and were moving towards runway, the pilot announced there was some technical fault with the plane and we have to go back. Well, we did the same 3 times and the plane spent 6 hours at Heathrow sitting on tarmac with all passengers on board. During these 6 hours we were not allowed to go back into the terminal and were only given water whilst business class passengers were offered food. The airline blamed Heathrow, but should have managed situation better. After 6 hours we finally took off to Helsinki. I missed my connecting flight and had to be rerouted. The were no more seats to Bangkok for days. They put me on a flight to Singapore and from there to Bangkok with Singapore Airlines. The whole trip was over 30 hours instead of 16 on the ticket. They also put my luggage on a different flight, but delivered it later to my hotel. As you can imagine, I did not enjoy this flight, but I'm not really blaming the airline cos I'm sure situations like this one are highly unusual. Flights overall are comfortable, good inflight entertainment, good food, but I was absolutely exhausted after 30 hours of flights and awful 6 hour delay.

My family and I traveled down from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Los Cabos (SJD) and back for winter break. The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster. We were delayed about 1 hour but managed to get to ORD ahead of schedule.,Detractor
"This round-trip flight was my first experience with flying Spirit Airlines. The initial price was significantly less than comparable round-trip flights. However the consumer should be aware that it is virtually impossible to travel Spirit Air without additional costs unless you can travel with just a backpack or other small carry-on item that will fit under the seat in front of you. Any additional baggage whether stowed or carry-on is charged. There is no complimentary food or beverage service and there is a fee to select your seat. After selecting my seat and paying for two bags (charged for each bag each way) my cost savings over other airlines was insignificant. In addition the in-flight service from the flight attendants was mediocre at best and the seat space was very cramped. The worst part about the experience however was the delays on both the outbound and return flights. My outbound flight was delayed nearly 3 hours and my return flight delayed 45 minutes. In neither case was the delay related to the weather air traffic control or anything related to the airport. In the first case the explanation given for the delay had to do with the aircraft being delayed for previous flights thus arriving late for my flight. On the return flight takeoff was delayed due to one of the flight attendants scheduled for my flight arriving late to the airport on another Spirit flight. The one gentleman in my row of seats on the return flight said how his outbound Spirit flight was also delayed. The other person in our row said when she booked her flight through a travel web site that she received a warning prior to confirming her purchase stating that 60% of Spirit flights are delayed. I can respect an airline for being ""no frills"" with the goal of keeping their costs low. However there is a difference between ""no frills"" and poor business practice. The delays appear to be the result of nothing other than airline inefficiency and the apparent consistency of delayed flights is inexcusable. To me that is not ""no frills"" but evidence of a business being poorly run. An airline can also be ""no frills"" but still provide friendly polite in-flight service. I'm not even talking here about the fact that they charge for all in-flight food and beverages but rather the general lack of friendliness and courteousness from the flight staff. I'm grateful to have been able to have a direct flight to my destination via Spirit and to have arrived to and from my destination safely. Beyond that my experience with the airline was mostly negative and I would not recommend Spirit Air unless it is your only option. If you do choose to fly Spirit beware of the specific costs travel light and plan for delays.",Detractor

I was warned by several family members to not fly with Ryanair but the flight I wanted with my friends was cheap so I didn't mind so much. I'm usually a very easy going person but Ryanair make my blood boil! They changed my flight time by more than 8 hours meaning that I would lose a day on my holiday I applied for a refund as did my three other friends for the coming home flight (We rebooked another coming home flight for a few days later with Ryanair) All of my friends got their refund however Ryanair refused to give me mine!

"  Copenhagen to Aalborg. Flying with SAS was a pleasant experience. The overall rating I'm giving is 9 of 10, because something edible is missing. A nice Scandinavian whole grain bun with something in it would be super! When flying domestic in Sweden I usually fly BRA, because of their inflight service. It's not just the cost of the bun but also the value of the atmosphere it creates in the cabin, when the staff is given a pretty simple tool to give service to the guests. Coffee / tea is fine - and better than nothing - but it lacks the edible component. Flying Norwegian on the other hand - with no service what so ever, and thus no atmosphere in the cabin - is a no go for me.",Promoter

Flew last month from Singapore to Beijing to New York JFK and return. Flight to Beijing and JFK went without trouble and the food in flight entertainment and service were reasonable. However upon landing at JFK we found that our bags hadn't even left Beijing. Had to wait 2 days for our bags to come to us. Flight from JFK to PEK was horrible as the air conditioning was not working and we sweated for 13 hours.

Flight to Singapore was delayed for one hour in which we sat on the airplane for an hour with very little explanation.

"Etihad Airways present themselves as a leading airline - are they for real?! I took a flight from Rome to Abu Dhabi in economy class, so I didn't expect anything special, but since this company apparently like to celebrate itself, I expected to be a bit better than regular economy - wrong expectation. The seats were narrow, uncomfortable and worn out. Space for legs was non existent. Service onboard was extremely poor, nobody really cares. My monitor didn't work so I asked the flight attendant if it was possible to sit somewhere else, the answer was ""we will let you know after take off"". Obviously soon after nobody cared any more about my request, and I didn't bother to ask again. I haven't seen a smile from the staff during the flight except for a male flight attendant (the only male), who was trying his best despite the miserable situation in economy. I was very thirsty so asked for some water and was told to wait for them to pass by with the trolley - a lady asked for the same thing and she received the same answer. We had to wait half an hour. At the end of the flight before leaving the plane they were in line with their plastic smile they need to have by the contract - apparently this only happens at the end of the flight.

Bucharest - Barcelona - Aalborg. Both my flights were absolutely event-free and quite pleasant! We took off on time (a minor 10 min delay from Barcelona as they had to unload luggage for a couple of passengers that missed the flight). Both take-offs and landings were smooth. Food on board was fair-priced I ordered a menu with a sandwich 0.5l drink (coke) and a snack (Pringles) and it all cost 8.50 euro. For a low-cost airline I think the service and flight was very good. The only reason I'm not rating it as great is because they did nothing outstanding. The only inconvenience was the checked-in luggage policy: regardless of how many bags you bring the weight limit is for the sum of all your bags and it's only 23 kg. Unfortunately I found out about this after paying 34 euro for a second bag (for 2 flight segments) and did not get a refund after deciding to bring just one bag. So pay attention to this aspect! If your checked luggage exceeds the 23 kg allowed you'll pay 12 euro / kilo.,Promoter

"British Airways online check in policy is now most appalling. Four times I have flown with them and three times myself and my girlfriend have been placed apart. This is even though we were on the same booking and once this has happened in business. British Airways charge you just for selecting a seat. Not a better seat, just any seat other than that automatically selected for you! The system seems designed to deliberately place you apart, even though it knows that you are together. Then it charges you Â£18 per seat to change your seat. If neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. They also won't let you checkin until 24 hours before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together. Both these practices are archaic, even with Ryanair, they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding. Monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat. With Ryan Air you can also checkin your return at the same time as your outward. British Airways have sunk to new depths and I will not fly them again.",Detractor

Boarding time for Sarajevo flight was 19:50. Flight attendant as we were approaching Vienna kindly moved us with our hand luggage to Business Class so we could be among first to exit plane. As we were not familiar with airport it took us sometime to locate gate for our onward flight and owing to age, health and mobility issues we were not in the best state when we got there.

I flew CZ328 from Los Angeles to Guangzhou on 17th May. Flight on time and A380 seats were comfortable. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. Food choices again limited. Inflight entertainment system broke down a couple of times and had to be rebooted. Business class cabin crew were polite and well spoken with eyes for details. All in all a good flight and recommended.,Promoter
GA368 SUB-SRG on Jan 7 2014. Although using Bombardier CRJ1000 and only 45 minutes flight Garuda Indonesia successfully managed to deliver service as pleasant as in Boeing 737-800 flights from Surabaya. Good cabin ambience in small aircraft. No PTVs but still got a complimentary snack. I am hoping that this route should be operated with larger aircraft soon because it is not easy to get cheap fares in full capacity routes like SUB-SRG.,Promoter
"  Okinawa to Siem Reap via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Hell on earth! Our first leg was late by an hour. That was both a precursor and the best part of the trip as it involves this airline. The crew was cold and the drinks were warm. When we arrived at our layover in Shanghai there were no representatives to assist passengers with directions. We ended up finding our gate with no assistance (and no smiles from any airport personnel). We arrived in Siem Reap two hours late. Luckily we had a great time in Cambodia! When it was time to return home the adventures began. While waiting in line at the ticket counter several Chinese tour groups started fighting amongst themselves. Then after we checked in and moved to the security lanes some of the members of these groups started skipping past the queue to get to the checkpoint. Mind you, this is still the good part. We were scheduled to leave at 2255 (10:55 pm). Our first delay was two hours. The airline counter said it was because of heavy traffic in Shanghai. We then sat around for another five hours with no word on when we'd leave or what the delay was. At approximately 1030 (am) we were given a coupon for food within the airport and told that the new time was set for 1230. By this time the tourist groups were literally in full revolt. Arguing with each other and verbally assaulting airport staff. No airline staff because they were nowhere to be found. Finally at 1500 (3:00 pm) we were put on a bus so we could board the plane. The flight from Siem Reap was uneventful but noisy. When we landed in Shanghai I asked on of the attendants for assistance finding where we needed to go in the airport. She led me and my family to the bottom of the stairs (at the airplane) and pointed to the bus. The transfer area in Shanghai is foreboding at best. When we walked to the queue a worker was berating a lady because she was asking where she needed to go next. Our process was uneventful that night but because of the delay we couldn't return home until the next day. Therefore we had to stay in a hotel out in Shanghai. That was another experience in and of itself but if dirty carpets, low water pressure, hard beds, and cigarette smoke smell is your thing, I know a place. At 0555 (5:55am) the next morning with no notice we got a knock on our door and a man speaking only two words - bus now! This part actually went smooth and the plane left only thirty minutes late. More cold flight attendants and warm drinks with one extra bonus. Not going to say why but we also got sick after the flight. Four days later and I'm still using Pepto Bismol (to help with nausea and diarrhea) . Funny part is my trip in Cambodia was only three days so the aftermath of the airline experience lasted longer than my trip. Never will use this airline again!",Detractor
I have travelled Sunwing twice (Cancun & Varadero) and have no complaints. Both times there was no delay getting to our location however when we were leaving Cuba out bus transfer was late and our plane was delayed by 1.5hrs. This was not the biggest issue since I love hanging out in airports and was in good company. The seats are not the best but I would say no worse then Air Canada or Westjet. I really enjoyed the hot towel you receive onboard. Food was so-so but we usually grab our own snacks and food before boarding.,Promoter
"  Melbourne to Munich via Doha with Qatar Airways. Really good price on tickets. Flights between Melbourne and Doha were aboard a B777-300ER. A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former. Really liked the amenities packages given on the long haul flights as well.",Promoter
JFK in business class to Madrid on to Barcelona and back. Seats were not great service was good. Food was average and entertainment TV service was very poor.

ARN-DOH-DAC and return in economy. ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent the IFE was modern flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.,Promoter
"  Brussels to Tel Aviv with very impolite staff. Paid USD 400 for a 4 hours return ticket, only to discover that no food and not even water was included. When I questioned the company's new policy and mentioned that this was not a low cost flight some staff from 'Supply' crew retorted this was in fact 'great for the company'. I was simply astounded. It is very debatable how great this is going to be in the long run. As soon as real low cost companies start the route let us all switch to those. We will see then how this absurd policies and ill treatment of paying customers will turn to be not so great for the company.",Detractor

Flew LHR-BUD 11 Sep BA866 and return 15 Sep BA 869 Club Europe. Early morning flight from T3 so breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty. BA can be hit and miss but I thoroughly enjoyed both flights. A great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.,Promoter

Flew from Narita/Tokyo to Copenhagen. The aircraft was old and everything was outdated. Blankets are filthy (lot of hair on the blanket) and entertainment screen resolution is horrible.. I didn't know it still exists but SAS entertainment isn't on-demand so you hope for the best and catch a movie that has just started. For a long haul like Asia-Europe (11.5 hours) it's just unbelievable. Cabin crews didn't even check who ordered special meals and they handed over meals to the wrong people. You have to pay for alcohol beverages (not that I care but again it is an intercontinental flight!) and each meal is very minimal. I compare SAS to other European airlines that operate between Asia and Europe and I definitely think SAS tickets are overpriced. Although Finnair isn't the best their flights are shorter and service is better and there isn't much difference in price.,Detractor

Our flight has been delayed by 10 hours (entailing an overnight wait). No explanation was given at any time. No hotel or anything at all was offered to us and I was traveling business class by the way. We couldn't even take a shower because they were supposedly ""out of towels"". And maybe worst of all, no apology for this whole impossible situation was ever offered. Basically, there has been zero communication or crisis management throughout. Their so-called business class lounge is a dump, I've never seen anything like it with old stained chairs and a hot water maker which had signs in Chinese only and was not working, smelly toilets etc etc. All in all, I honestly can't believe this whole thing has actually happened and has cost me ten hours of my life.

Travelled back from Cape Town on 28th February 2015. Booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! Complained to BA and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. What a total rip off! The seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. Once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing!

"My family and I were getting ready to fly to Hawaii on a family vacation. Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after.

"Berlin to Dublin via Copenhagen. This has to be the worst legacy short haul airline in Europe. On the shortest leg, Berlin to Copenhagen, we were served 1 mint chocolate. No drink service nothing at all. The male staff member spoke to a passenger near us, regarding where to put a bag, with total contempt. I have never heard such a rude purser. On the 2 hour flight to Dublin, we were served 1 drink of coffee and that was it. The seating is cattle class, very tight and uncomfortable. They allowed a clearly drunk passenger to shout and swear at his friends across the isle, which offended most of the plane. This tirade went on until we landed. The stewardesses just smiled at them and thought it was all very funny. During the booking process, cancellation insurance was added, which was not wanted, nor ordered. I immediately emailed the airline, but heard nothing from them for 3 days. When I did hear from them, the email told me to call Customer Services. CS had me on hold for 40 minutes and then refused to do anything, as I should have notified them straight away that I did not require the insurance. I explained that I had informed the airline immediately, via the email SAS provided for such complaints. They then gave me a phone number of the insurer. I called it, this was incorrect. The number SAS gave me was for an old insurance company, who had not provided their insurance for over 8 months. I tried to contact the insurer via the details on the policy, every email bounced back and was ""Undeliverable"". In the end I gave up trying to cancel it. Terrible.

I have never experienced an airline as terrible as TAP, it would be laughable if the situation weren't horrible. If you could get a worker to actually speak with you long enough rather than shooing you away chances are they will genuinely try to help which is probably it's only redeeming factor, but it's clear that company wide there is no emphasis on the people it flies, or ever getting them where they paid to be.

CPH-LHR earlier today. I am travelling on this route every week and fly both BA and SAS depending on price and schedule. This morning I was booked on SAS and suffice to say it was not one of their finest moments. The flight was delayed and it turned out to be a two hour-delay before we finally reached London. The staff working onboard today's flight must have been through an unusually rough patch before getting onboard this flight. I have rarely seen a slower and more disengaged team of employees in any line of work. It took almost 45 minutes to dish out a few sandwiches and drinks. Need I say that at that pace the crew did not have the time to clear the trash before landing. Compared to BA and their upgraded cabins I think the SAS Airbus 321 is looking shabby. There is no finer way of putting it. If I am not mistaken this aircraft has not really been revamped since it was put into use about 15 years ago and it shows! I think it is high time for SAS to take some action here. All in all SAS are generally more expensive than BA on this route and I know this after flying every week on this route for a while. However paying more to go with SAS also means that you have to pay extra for food and drinks travel in a run-down cabin and may run into the team I had to endure today. Given that this is probably a very attractive segment for SAS I just do not understand why they provide such a poor-quality product and expect to get away with it.,Detractor

Flew from Luton to Vilnius return. The flights themselves were acceptable - condition of planes decent not much room in seats but I'm short so not a particular problem for me although I did hear taller passengers complaining. Lots of selling to passengers mid-flight but this is as you would expect from a budget airline. I personally did not have problems with baggage allowances but took care to read the online information carefully following the negative comments on this site. Where Wizz fell down for me was in the information provided to passengers at the airport - for both the outward and return journeys there were 60 minute delays with little information forthcoming as to why. The delay on the way home in particular was shocking - passengers were actually 'boarded' through the gate when the plane had not even reached Vilnius. This meant 200 people were kept cooped up between the gate and the runway in sweltering conditions with no access to water or WC's for an hour without any information as to why. Bad for people with kids in particular. This approach must have been taken purely for the convenience of the staff themselves - poor.,Passive

Return was even better as Captain announced the Northern Lights which was truly awesome and window seated pax shared time for a view. Food could be better but ham and cheese baggette tasty and Islandic Gull beer good value if you buy the two set. Staff pleasant at all times. Given I paid only Â£313 for the return, I was very pleasantly surprised. Will travel WOW again if the price dictates so. Baggage checks on size were being enforced at LAX on return although some flexibility given. LAX check in staff were fantastic and wished everyone a pleasant trip home.",Promoter
"  San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need. On the plus side Business Class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive. BA need to do better though, far better if they are to compete with the good Middle East and Far Eastern airlines.",Detractor
" Johannesburg to Sydney. I am a regular on Qantas and their A380 and Boeing 787-9. So in comparison the Boeing 747 serving this route needs to be replaced.

"  Flew Nice to Gatwick. Â£3.00 for a sandwich in Club Class. We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of SeÃ±or Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What",Detractor
"Flew Emirates from MAN-DXB, outbound flight 02/12/15. Excellent service by the crew on the morning flight from Manchester, the 777 was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was the older ICE system but it worked well with plenty of choices of movies, TV programmes and music. Wi-Fi available on this aircraft and it worked well for the bargain price of a $1.00. Meal service was a let down as the food was cold and the portions seemed to have shrunk since my last flight with Emirates last year. Plenty of drink runs available and the flight was only half full so plenty of space available. Landed in to Dubai 20 minutes earlier. I much prefer the 777 over the A380.",Promoter
" After extensive delays with no communication from ground staff, we boarded our Bangkok to Singapore flight. There were about 60 of us total on an Airbus 350 that held five times that many people, so everyone had plenty of room to spread out. The 350 is a great aircraft, and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of these-they're quiet, spacious, and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics (they fold in-and out) the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand, and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesn't need another glowing review-it was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly, trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch, though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing, the volume is adequate without being turned up too high-it helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude. Make the effort to fly this plane and Cathay if it's going where you are.",Promoter
"  Los Angeles to Mammoth Lakes. I purchased a ticket through American Airlines, received an email confirmation through American Airlines but was expected to know that I was supposed to go to the Alaskan airlines gate. So I walked from terminal 4 to terminal 6, checked my bags and got my boarding pass and went to gate 65A. I then asked the lady working at gate 65A where gate 65B was and how much time I had to board the plane. It was 7:40 at the time, my boarding pass said 8:10, she said that gate 65B was just right next to her. I went to the restroom and came back to gate 64A thinking gate 64B was right next to her based on the information given to me, to find out gate 64B was actually down the hall and around the corner. By the time I got to gate 64B it was 7:59. My friend told the lady working at gate 64B that I was in the restroom and I would be there in just a minute but they closed the flight anyway. I could see the plane right outside the door, about 40-50 feet away. It was a small plane with the step ladder still attached to it. They did not accommodate me in any way whatsoever. Very misleading and uninformative. I was scheduled to fly out and come back the same day so catching another flight wasn't an option. My trip was scrapped and subsequently ruined.",Detractor
"Frankfurt to Nagasaki via Tokyo. This company is really amazing! First, as a tourist you can fly across Japan for a mere 80â‚¬, at any time which is really convenient. The planes are in perfect condition, cleanliness amazin and the flight attendants very caring. Maybe the 777 is quite noisy, but the new 787 operated on many domestic and international routes are great. The meals are good, and the inflight entertainment is top of the range, with a lot of choice, big screen. In Premium Economy you even have noise cancelling headphones, which is valuable for long haul flights! In addition, for domestic flights, we have a really huge leg space. Tickets can be pricey, but there are regular promotional campains that make the fares really affordable, and for the same price, you can have connecting flights to any city in Japan. That makes it a really good deal. Ground service is flawless.",Promoter

"  Zurich to Dubai with Swiss Intl. Check-in at the economy counter had a long queue but was managed well by the efficient staff. Having checked in online this helped a lot as all they need to do is to scan the bar code and print the luggage tags. At the gate there was another long line but as a Star Alliance Gold memebr I was fortunate to enter with the premium passengers. The seats were the Recaro ones and quite cofmrtable actually for economy class. Every seat had a blanket, pillow, TV, USB point, headphones available - something you would long to see in any US carrier. Magazines and newspapers were kept in different areas of the cabin but extremely disappointing that not a single one was in English. Swiss needs to know that not every passenger on their flights speak German or French. We departed on time and service commenced quickly and very efficiently. I admire the Swiss efficiency. Drinks were offered with salty biscuits and then lunch as a choice of 1 vegetarian option of noodle or a non-veg of chicken with aubergines. Serve with salad, dessert and Swiss cheese as well as additional large cans of soft drinks made this a very good meal for economy. The IFE needs to improve. The crew patrolled several times to offer water for the passengers and an hour before landing Movenpick ice cream was distributed which was a very nice touch. Just before landing Swiss chocolates were given as well. I have nothing but praise for this airline.",Promoter

"First class Beijing to Sydney. They started boarding economy class passengers before first and business! It was only when staff noticed me standing in the first class queue that they figured that I should probably go in now. The first class cabin is nice and I liked my seat. However, service onboard was horrible. The flight attendant barely spoke English, and when she asked what I wanted for dinner, I didn't understand half the choices. There was no printed menu, so I had to make a choice based on what little words I were able to grab from the flight attendant. The food was okay. There were maybe 5 dishes that were mostly good, except for the main dish which was some type of meat that didn't taste good. I didn't get a wine list at any point. The entertainment system was ok, but not that many choices in terms of US films and shows. And the ones available had Chinese subtitles that you couldn't turn off. And before each title started there were long commercials. After the flight attendant turned my seat into a comfy bed, I didn't see her for the next 8 hours or so. She didn't set foot in the cabin. So no way to order more drinks or snacks. And there was no bar or lounge area. I saw the flight attendant again maybe an hour before landing when it was time for breakfast. Food was good and comprehensive. Generally I would not recommend Air China if you plan to shell out for a first class ticket!",Detractor

"LHR to Guangzhou, and onto to Brisbane. Six weeks later Sydney to London via Guangzhou. Check in at LHR and Sydney seamless. LHR lounge perfectly adequate. Greeting on board Boeing 787 was brilliant. Plenty of legroom with fully flat bed seats. Fittings inside the aircraft perhaps a little less luxurious than some airlines, but no complaints. Lavatories were excellent and were kept clean throughout all flights. Flights were smooth with some turbulence on occasions. FAs were thoughtful, helpful and charming. Food was the equal of any airline I have flown and Asian as well as Western dishes available. Actually enjoyed the food I had. Did not try the wines as we never drink alcohol on flights, but selection looked good. Arrival Guangzhou was on time. Unexpectedly the Jet-Way led straight to stairs and a waiting coach for terminal transfer. Four hours in perfectly adequate lounge and then taken to next aircraft - an A330. Similar high standards on board airbus. Again FAs excellent. Have never come across FAs who were more helpful and attentive. Arrive BNE on time.

"  Landed in Dallas after a 16 hr direct flight from Dubai with EK. Got my luggage and lmmediately checked into my Dallas to Mexico City flight. The layover which was want to be three hours became 6hrs and was now at risk of overlapping my final flight from Mexico City to Tampico. We arrived at Mexico City with an hour to spare and considering there were several delays faced by Aeromexico on December 23rd, and that the next flight to Tampico was the latest outbound flight, we whre sure we could make it. Then the aircraft parked in a remote location, we waited 10 mins for the bus to arrive and we spent 10 mins in the bus outside the plane after everyone had got on, we then waited outside the terminal building for another 10 mins with the doors closed because the Aeromexico staff where confused at our arrival. At this point the tampico flight had left and we stood in line for 2 hrs waiting to solve the issue. Aeromexico's response is that it's due to weather in Tampico and there is nothing they could do except put us on the next flight at 6:20 am the following day. We waited. At 6:20 am they said there is one cabin crew member they couldn't locate, after several hours we boarded the bus and arrived at the plane, the doors opened and the staff told us weather in Tampico had become bad and we needed to go back to the terminal. The flight was delayed hour on hour until 10:30 when they decided to cancel the flight. They said we needed to call customer service, international call - we rushed back to the check-in area and pleaded with the supervisor on duty, he said he couldn't do anything. During all of this, this 13 hour delay in Mexico City preceded by a 6 hour delay in Dallas, we were never offered an apology, a glass of water, a blanket or bed to sleep in or a morsel of food. There is definitely something fishy going on with the airline management. I will never fly Aeromexico again. In the end we collected our luggage with security, booked a cab to the bus terminal and took a 7 hour bus journey with several others from our flight to tampico, the worst customer experience I have ever had especially because the staff showed not an ounce of humility or compassion.",Detractor

From the moment that we arrived at the airport check in desk to the moment we landed we were given very little information and no apology.

"  Montreal to Vancouver. We arrived at the airport with lots of time to spare prior to our flight. One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to â€˜talk' anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted â€˜volunteers' to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasn't my name but the lady took our â€˜boarding passes' and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had â€˜sb' in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning.

This is a great airline for hopping around Asia. I made several trips (via BKK). I found there to be a great consistency of service on all flights. Some of their planes are a bit older than others (our flight to Siem Reap was a turbo prop) and slightly more uncomfortable. Inflight service was of a very high standard. Very friendly crew and adequate food for each flight.

If you have option to fly with someone other than Austrian take it. Because as I'm flying Geneva-Vienna there is unfortunately no other option if it was the case I wouldn't fly with Austrian.,Detractor

"Sydney - HKG - Milan and return Premium Economy. Sadly disappointed. Having flown premium economy or business on a number of airlines in recent years this definitely felt ""economy"". Service food and beverages were very average. Seat and entertainment acceptable. I note that the cost was equivalent to Singapore Airlines economy class via Singapore. Next time we'll opt for SA. Neither the food or the beverages offered were business class equivalent. Did I misunderstand what we were paying for? The crew were rarely seen but happy to step across passengers in the front row. No ""excuse me's"" were offered. The only flight where service was up to standard was HK-Sydney when the aircraft was not full. If this was ""premium"" we'll opt for economy on another airline!",Detractor

The only complaint we have is the way they board their passengers. On the American air carriers, the first and business class passengers are always boarded first prior to the economy class. The only time Icelandair did this was at Newark. At the European airports, everyone was asked to board at the same time. When we confronted Icelandair, they said they didn't have the facilities to do this. You don't need facilities. All you need is to use the microphone to call out asking for the Saga class to board. The wine choices were good. The food was typical airline food. The attention from the FA's was very good. If you want seat comfort for a long flight then Saga class is worth the money.",Promoter

"  We booked an Etihad return ticket and on the way back from Jakarta to Stuttgart via Abu Dhabi our flight from Abu Dhabi (operated by Air Berlin) was canceled. Original arrival time in Stuttgart 7am. We presumed Etihad would change our booking according to the new connection they were selling on the website that day (from Abu Dhabi via Belgrad to Stuttgart, arrival time around 8 am) but in Abu Dhabi they lied to our faces and said there was no such connection. There was a flight departing to Belgrad while we were at the airport! So they booked us on a flight to Berlin but said the flights from Berlin to Stuttgart were already full so we would have to wait 8 hours in Berlin before flying to Stuttgart (arrival time 4.20pm). Etihad wouldn't provide any food vouchers or anything and no food on the last flight from Berlin to Stuttgart (operated by Air Berlin). The Etihad flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi wasn't great either, cabin crew seemed to be stressed out and unsmiling. Drinks were hard to come by, food portion size was small and not every option available. They ran out of vegeterian food. When we tried to order a veggie meal online beforehand it didn't work.

I filled in a form at Perth airport, but they didn't give or email me a copy with a case number, so I can't make a claim for necessary expenses.

The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much.

Furthermore, Qantas does not allow you to choose your seat at the online check-in, which is a major inconvenience if you are travelling with people who are not in the same reservation.

" Los Angeles to Manila via Guangzhou. Service is good, but international transfers are hectic. This was my 4th time to fly China Southern Airlines. I like the A380 because it is very quiet and comfortable. However, their A380 is starting to look dated. I booked my flight directly on their website, however, they do not allow seat reservations for the upper deck. They did a couple of years ago. It's a shame because i booked it directly and not from another website. If you want the upper deck seats you'll have to pay Y100 per segment. I also ordered a ""diabetic"" meal, and that was not satisfying. So, I deleted that for the next flights. The meals are less stellar than they used to be. The seats are the same, stiff. The transfer at Guangzhou airport was ok, but if you walk slow, it'll take you a while because the new terminal is huge. There are two security checks. The second one is through the x-ray machines. That takes a lot more time and the queue gets slower to the x-ray machines. The flight to MNL was uneventful. On the return flight, the snafu started after the plane landed on the tarmac. We had to be bused to the new Terminal for international transfer. Because the lay over time is only 1 hour and 10 minutes to LAX, almost everyone is in a hurry. Again, the two times security check is the culprit. Apparently, almost every connecting flight is leaving late because of it. My LAX flight was delayed an hour from waiting for connecting passengers. When we arrived at the gate, it was still boarding. The chaotic and unorganized transfer procedure was exhausting, to say the least. Despite the hour delay, the flight arrived in LAX on time. Until Guangzhou airport streamlines their transfer process, expect chaos and delays in your connecting flights. Otherwise, everything is just fine.",Promoter

  Tel Aviv to Madrid via Athens. I give kudos to Aegean for having a specific section on their booking website for indicating the disability of a passenger but it is regrettable that they don't make better use of the information provided. My wife is blind and travels with a guide dog. While US airlines are very good at making accommodations for guide dogs our experience is that European airlines have less understanding of reasonable accommodation. I recognize that Aegean does not have a typical bulkhead that allows a little more space for an assistance dog and they did block out the center seat on both flights on check in but instead of providing a seat in the first few rows of coach we were placed in row 18 and row 19 on the legs between Tel Aviv and Athens and Athens and Madrid respectively. Being right in the center of the plane meant that it was necessary to negotiate a much longer stretch of the narrow center corridor for embarkation and disembarkation and much more difficult access to bathroom facilities. The odd thing was that after completing my reservation online I called Aegean and was specifically assured that we would be placed in the first row of coach class. Obviously a wasted call because when we got to the airport we were told they had no seats set aside for us and were even unsure if they would even be able to block out the center seat on the second leg. Aegean would do well to take some lessons from Delta or American on how to handle guide dogs. The other issue I had was that the plane was way to hot!! On both flights I asked if the temperature could be lowered. I was informed that the ends of the plane were maintained at 24 degrees C which meant that the center of the plane got much hotter and they would not lower the temperature to better serve the center because they would then get complaints about the plane being too cold. Whereas if the plane is too cold a person can add additional clothing but if the plane is too hot then if one is already down to shirt sleeves ther is not much else one can take off and remain decent. Obviously this is a serious design flaw with the equipment with the equipment that is used by Aegean but perhaps they should re-examine the cabin temperature they maintain so that people in the center of the plane don't have to endure excessive heat. The overall rating I am giving is for the issues discussed above. Without these two unfortunate circumstances my rating would be an 8 or 9!,Passive

When I'm on a plane that has TVs, I usually watch a movie on my iPad and turn the TV to the map channel. It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that's just how things happen at O'Hare), the screen told me that my ""free preview"" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me).

" Ryanair is the worst airline. They're are incredibly greedy for money and cant find enough ways to steal from you. I've flown with them before but never again! Firstly the ticket is affordable but each bag costs Â£40 which means the cost of bags will exceed the ticket (so flying with a more expensive airline with more benefits and quality assurance will technically equal the money you will spend with Ryanair). Secondly, unlike every other airline it now requires you to pay Â£6 (yes because Â£80 isnt enough) for you to be able to take a small bag on board. I took a small trolley bag as I knew this was the policy and they still tagged it. My bag had no lock, was not strong enough to be put in the deck and had very delicate things inside. They only gave me time to remove my computer and all my appliances/makeup/many other products were left to be thrown away in the deck (and we both know what happens, bag breaks and all my things inside break). The best part is they only tell you about this policy in an e-mail after you buy the ticket! Yes it is written in the small letters of the terms, yet they know we don't always read it all, especially when I've flown with them before and never had to do it so just assumed everthing was the same. When boarding, I realise half the top shelfs were empty which means this could all have been avoided, but like I said, money tops it all for this airline.

However I felt the layout of Premium Economy wasn't the best as there is only one toilet in Premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin. This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid. The only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice, I've traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films. Overall I would travel with Cathay Pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class.",Promoter
" Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou. When I was boarding i noticed that a lot of passengers had quite a few carry-on baggage. Even with the cabin crew help, it took me a while to find a space for my suitcase in this old Boeing 737. 4 hours flight was long enough for me and there were no plug to charge my phone. I liked the foods and drinks they provided and i got refill couple times. So no complaints for services but it could be a better experience with an bigger and fancier aircraft.",Promoter
" The online check-in assign couple who book flight together at opposite end of the plane and both middle seats! At the time of check in, 71% of the seats are empty, we thought with so many seats available we should be able to sit together as both of our name are under the same booking code. They assign my seat at the front of the plane and my husband at the very back of the plane and both middle seats. Then immediately take me to the page where I can pay for our seats so that we can sit together, and they are Â£9 per sit per trip, so it will be Â£36 more if we want to sit together.

" Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney. I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us.( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days. But no reply from Air Canada until now. Money wise we are not losing anything but this was making us nervous. Unnecessary stress. Especially my mother. 150$ is lots of money. But I think next time I won't worry about even 500$.",Detractor

"Rome to Cairo. My problem with Alitalia started back in the end of October where I purchased online a ticket from FCO to CAI. Although I paid the amount advertised which was on a special offer, I never received confirmation nor my flight ticket. From there on, my ordeal started and is still ongoing. It has been 2 months already that I cannot get my refund nor a clarification whether I am on the flight I booked or not. After numerous calls to the customer service and waiting time around 15'each call, the only answer I am getting is that the airline's system is down and the soonest it is fixed they will deal with my issue as I am on a queue of around 3000 passengers. Unbelievable and simply ridiculous! Besides having to spent so much time on the phone and only receiving apologies for the inconvenience and no solution, I had to contact the department via email too, and the only answer I have received is that there's nothing they can do for my problem and the only way to solve it is by phone. This is not a workable solution either. I have spent around 300â‚¬ for a flight which I don't even know if I am on, no information provided, nor explanation or confirmation that I will be refunded. I am beyond frustrated as there seems to not be a solution and for such an enterprise, someone would expect some kind of customer service to say the least. it is a matter of decency, respect and appreciation for the customer to be able to solve such an issue quickly and provide feedback. Apparently Alitalia has no concerns for these principles. After 11 years of flying with this airline, I am completely done with it.",Detractor

I booked 3 full fare flights to Cabo San Lucas on line at aircanada.com. Air Canada changed my direct flight from Cabo to Toronto twice prior to my departure. The first change had me stopping in Houston for a layover and then on to Toronto. Clearly not what I paid for. Shortly after that flight was changed routing me through San Francisco on a 'red eye' that had me arriving home Monday morning at 5.55am. I was to arrive home on Sunday evening but finally arrived home on Tuesday morning at 10am after they had handed me off to United who simply overbooked my flight.

Madrid to JFK. I fly Madrid - New York at least 4 times a year and this was the worst flight experience I have had. I was surrounded by a group of about 20 middle school students. They were all standing sitting on each other's laps kneeling on their seats and yelling across the aisles. Obviously this was not the fault of Air Europa but I have never been on a flight where passengers were allowed to be out of their seats like that for the entire flight. I asked the flight attendant if she could say something to them and she responded that she couldn't really do anything. She murmured something about finding me another seat and never returned. I later found out the flight was not full and my seat could have easily been changed. My seat wasn't aligned properly so I had to place my feet on either side of the seat in front of me which was uncomfortable. The seats didn't have individual TVs which isn't such a big deal. Unfortunately the American-made inflight movie was only available dubbed in Spanish. I asked the flight attendant which channel was the English channel because I could not find it after scrolling through all of the options. She vaguely muttered that it should be available and said she would go ask and once again didn't return. This flight cost me about the same as most others I have taken on this route but the customer service was abysmal. Equally expensive flight for worse experience. I will be avoiding Air Europa in the future.,Detractor

Over the course of two flights (roundtrip) we contacted American Airlines customer service about 7-8 times both over the phone and in person at the airport (customer service desk, gate agent) all regarding the same issue. They all gave us different answers and in some cases flat out incorrect information. We had issues with seats, with bags, but most importantly - when people are paying - any amount of money for that matter - you address their concerns in some way. After this awful travel experience we contacted their corporate customer service and got basically - sorry - can't help, fly with us again please. Even worse they clearly didn't even read the complaint. In the response they addressed the wrong issue and claimed I was travelling with my wife (I was travelling with my husband). Their lack of concern for customers is evident in the fact that they can't even read their emails fully. The whole process has just been incredibly frustrating - this business should be ashamed of themselves.",Detractor

Priority immigration and security documents are issued to premium laurel passengers. Even bags are priority.

"I flew from Toronto to Abu Dhabi and two weeks later the reverse trip. I'll start by saying that I've flown a lot domestically in Canada and internationally though my two Etihad flights were the longest flights I've ever had. My previous longest flights have been in the six hour range to and from European destinations while my Etihad flights were in the 12 hour range. I'm 6' 3"" tall so legroom is always an important consideration. The legroom on Etihad wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad either. When the passenger in front of me fully reclined my knees were just touching the seatback on an Air Canada flight several years ago I had to contort because of the lack of legroom on a flight from France to Canada. Regarding inflight entertainment there were enough movies and TV shows to keep me going when I wasn't dozing.

"My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.",Detractor
"  I was extremely satisfied with WOW Airlines and recommend them. We got an exceptional deal on tickets from LAX to CDG. I was initially hesitant to fly with them based on online reviews. I read about frequent delays and lack of customer service. Speaking solely from my experience, they were punctual and the customer service was exceptional. I suspect the bulk of complaints arise from the fact that they have luggage size restrictions and they do not provide meals and in-flight entertainment as part of the ticket price. However, you're flying to Europe for 1/5 the price of many airlines! To cope with these limitations, I suggest to bring your own entertainment, load up on food at the airports, pack lightly (invest in a good backpack) and make sure you have a buffer in your schedule since most WOW flights have layovers in Iceland (which is an incredible place). My wife and I have always wanted to explore Europe. WOW provided a deal attractive enough to make it a reality.

"Aer Lingus from Chicago to London Heathrow via Dublin having flown on the outbound flight in December. All flights were comfortable, on time and the service on the ground and in the air was pretty good. The check in at Chicago had no queue and staff were friendly and polite. Plenty of drinks served (all alcoholic beverages are chargeable which makes them appear more of a budget airline). Planes in good condition and seat space was good. -Inflight entertainment was limited. There was a limited collection of movies (some new releases) and screen size was quite small. However good headphones provided and good music. A330's have wifi which was a decent connection, but costs a fair bit and severely limits the data you have available. The online check in is useless. There were three of us flying. It showed no availability for seats (other than once available for upgrade). We booked through expedia but individuals booking through Aer Lingus can select the seats and all others have to wait until check in. As a result, on the outbound leg, we didn't all sit together. They mucked up our meals on the inbound leg from Chicago to Dublin. We requested vegetarian meals on the return leg. However none were available. The crew instead gave a small basket of fruits as a substitute that was wholly inadequate. So if you have a meal request, make sure you are travelling with some food (or confirm at check in). In general however, food was of average quality on the way out. The flight was fairly well priced for the time of the year though so can't complain too much.",Passive

LHR-IST-LHR over the Christmas - We use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from London with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service. B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,Promoter

" I had the worst experience with an airline, delayed flights, I leave Chicago with the late flight, arrive in Orlando to go to PR, they change my ticket in Chicago because I was not going to arrive in time to MCO to take the flight for PR, and to my surprise, I arrived in Orlando and the plane for PR had not left, I ask you to please allow me to leave on that flight that was originally mine, and the staff with such bad manners answered me that they can not do nothing because I had changed it, when they changed it to me in Chicago, I had to stay stuck in Orlando until 12 noon the other day, the flight on the way to Chicago happened to me something similar. They charge you for the water you consume on the plane, and the disgusting staff at the Gates! They are not Organized, for me they are the worst line that I have had to travel, cheap passages that end up being more expensive after all!

"Really disappointed that I chose to fly with Gulf Air. We travelled with our one year old who was too young for his own seat and too heavy for a baby bassinet. The airline seats at the front of economy were cramped and didn't allow for the arm rests to be raised. I therefore spent 7 hours holding my child while he slept. This meant that I could not eat or drink until after my wife had finished. The staff on our outbound flight were miserable and unfriendly. Our return flight was extremely hot. Our entertainment system on both the outbound and inbound flight was stuck, and when we asked for help we were told to push down a button which didn't work so we went the entire flight without any entertainment.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Seoul with Asiana Airlines. My window was dirty, my headrest and my pillow covers were not changed (covers in fabric so passengers cannot always notice it, but the smell was just terrible. The blanket was the one used for the previous flight (just folded on the seat, not sealed in a plastic bag as it should be). When I asked for a ""clean blanket"" the FA did not really seem to realize what I meant. Extremely disappointed by these kind of practices. I usually have issues with Asiana regarding dirty windows so I usually ask the FA a wet tissue to clean it. When traveling on a legacy airline, cleanliness is an issue for me, since it's basic respect for passengers. By comparison, I flew Korean Air several times and never had such issues. Take off at 00:40 and ""dinner"" served at 2am. Seriously, the only things passengers want to do at this time is to sleep. FA woke up all the passengers by asking them to put up their seats. Choice was not appropriate - porridge or sea food. I did not take any of them. A breakfast, before arriving at Incheon would have been more suitable. The quantity of movies loaded in the IFE is just a huge joke. The movie application is divided into themes and in Hollywood or classics you would find only have 3 to 4 movies.",Detractor
"BCN-CDG-HND in Premium Economy. The first leg from BCN had drama. It was the last flight of a day when a flight had been cancelled earlier and seating was overbooked. I was assigned a middle seat. One of the flaws of their intra-Europe flights is that you cannot ever book your seat in advance and I paid for my ticket 8 months in advance! Previously I was served a meal on this short flight but not this one. We were only given a small dry sandwich and a cup of water (no second drinks service). The flight attendant in charge seemed to care less about anyone in the ""premium cabin"". Air France make no effort to distinguish the intra-Europe premium economy experience apart from you being seated near the front. The late night flight to HND on a newly refurbished 777-200 was actually quite nice. The crew were very accommodating and the toilets were clean throughout. The premium economy seat was OK but you cannot get any sleep in them as many have said. The entertainment system is updated with touch screens though I couldn't find much to watch. I ordered a special Lentore meal in advance and it was delicious. The standard pre-arrival breakfast was dreadful. No food offered between meal times during the 11+ hour flight. The only good thing about being in premium economy is knowing you're not squeezed into economy. Overall not a very positive experience for me this journey.",Passive

Food was boring looking and not in a great quantity. Bread not very well heated. What is worst is that they serve filtered water from jars. Breakfast of congee or eggs with sausage. I believe that CX catering is most boring and predictable. Service was efficient but very cold. Next time I would consider flying with EK or QR.

" Paris to Brisbane via Singapore. Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer.

First class on this new 737-900 seems to have more leg room than what I recall from the old first class. Add to that the comfy seats and the experience is quite OK. This 3+ hour flight from San Francisco to Houston had a much improved service - the United staff finally seem to be having some fun and are proud again of their airline. It shows. Besides the service the meals have also improved. There are more healthy choices such as a salad with grilled chicken and fresh toppings chicken wrap and the likes. And then there are those sumptuous warm chocolate cookies that they serve at the end. This flight had not IFE so I resorted to using my iPad and paid for the very inexpensive inflight wifi service.

"I moved to Sydney from Canada and flew with Air Canada. I had my carry-on luggage approved at the beginning of my trip with the proper tags. On a connecting flight, I was told I would have to check one of my bags at the gate because the plane was full. Once on the plane, I had an entire row to myself and thought it was very strange that I was forced to check a bag onto a plane that was clearly not full. Once I arrived in Sydney, my bag checked at the gate did not come out with the rest of the baggage. I spoke with 5 or more airline reps to try to figure out what happened to my bag over the course of a couple days and received different answers each time. In the beginning my bag was just missing and no one could tell me where it was. If I have been forced to check a bag unnecessarily it should not just ""go missing"". Later in the week I heard varying other stories and eventually realized my bag was just not put on my flight at all. I understand that airlines cannot always fit all baggage, but the least Air Canada could have done in this situation is to track where the bags are in order to avoid unnecessary stress. I eventually got my luggage but had to go through a lot of confusion and stress over it. I was moving across the world and did not need the added stress of a bag being missing. I was also approved by an agent to be reimbursed $100 for missing items after submitting claim with receipts. I submitted a claim to be reimbursed for one of my items missing a month ago and have still not received anything back 3 months later.

Flying from Faro to Glasgow Prestwick. I have flown with Ryanair before on short flights from Glasgow to Dublin which were fine (although had us standing outside in the freezing cold waiting to board for 20 minutes). Faro to Glasgow was a 3 hour flight and I am 6 months pregnant. I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up. Also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. I didn't see any cabin crew addressing this. I would only fly Ryanair for very short flights if desperate.

" Amsterdam to Detroit via Keflavik. This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment. I know how so-called low cost airlines operate and have never had a problem with any of them until my partner and I tried to fly WOW for the first (and last) time. This is a complaint about the treatment we received and the fees we were charged at the gate of our flight WW447 AMS-KEF, on the date of September 3 at AMS (Schiphol) airport. We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that ""wheels"" cannot be placed under seats due to ""safety."" This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about â€“ extorting money from travelers. If the company wants to prohibit the use of wheeled luggage, it must define the included luggage as such excluding wheels, otherwise am free to interpret the shape or pattern of the luggage freely, as long as it complies with the measurements, which it did.

I recently had a one way flight from CPH to CDG. The flight itself was not terrible but the process of checking my bags was. I had planned on checking only one bag and carrying two. As soon as I got to the bag drop counter an SAS employee came up and told me I have to check one of my carry-on bags as well. It's not like either bag was huge. I fly frequently with the same carry-on bags and have never had a problem before. So besides the inconvenience and extra unexpected cost of rearranging and checking a second bag the trip was fairly smooth however the seat was fairly hard and uncomfortable. I am a furniture designer and can tell you that the lumbar support was in the wrong place. I am six feet tall which is a very average height and it seemed too high. Reclining didn't help matters because of how hard the seat was. I could not get comfortable in the chair throughout the entire trip.

"My fiancÃ© booked a surprise package deal for our honeymoon that included airfares on Spirit. There are some clear cut pros and cons with this airline. The good: Cheap fares new planes and assigned seating. The actual airfare you'll pay is cheap however there are other fees to be found. More on that in the bad. The planes appeared to be modern and new. We enjoyed plenty of leg room and a clean bathroom. Having assigned seating takes a little pressure off boarding as well. The bad: At the best unhelpful at the worst rude employees and staff. Excessive baggage fares. When my husband and I checked in 1 hr 10 mins early we were told we were late and had late arrival written all over our boarding passes and luggage. Spirit boards 1 hour before scheduled departure.

" Air India Mumbai to Bengaluru. The check in counters were full of passengers as there were only 2 check in personnel who were there so the airline could have done better in staffing more check in agents at the desks which would have sped up the process. Even though the flight departed 30 mins after the scheduled time, we made up for the time on air and reach the destination 15 mins after arrival which was appreciated. Surprisingly the airline had opted for the A319 on this route even though the flight was full. Dinner was served on this flight which consisted of mixed vegetables with a paratha and biryani which was quite tasty. The crew were also enforcing the rules such as ensuring that no pax were roaming around when the seatbelt sign was on which was quite positive and showed that they were serious about their jobs. This was one of the better BOM-BLR flights I had taken.",Promoter
"  CX 410, Hong Kong to Incheon on a B777-300, very punctual. Disliked the shell seat with no recline, but otherwise the flight was pleasant. Great entertainment choices and attentive staff. Breakfast was acceptable but not outstanding. CX 419 returning to HKG on a newer A330-300 with better seat which could recline. Same entertainment system. Food was not as good as expected. Some crew members were indifferent which was below the standard of normal CX crew, but the inflight service manager was very friendly and helpful. Overall CX has still been rather consistent with satisfactory services.",Promoter

Bogota to Las Vegas via Fort Lauderdale. Terrible experience very dirty flight and extremely disorganized passenger service and operations. This airline having know the fact that it takes time to go through border control and homeland security gave us less than 1 hour at Fort Lauderdale airport to go through the security and immigration check during peak hours with over 300 odd passengers in a queue. This was at 18.45 hrs I was supposed to be on my next flight unfortunately with Spirit at 20.00 so we had roughly 35 mins. As a result I missed my flight. In spite of the fact that the airlines knew that so many passengers were stuck in the queue with immigration they didn't bother to delay the flight by few minutes and left us in limbo. I went to the service staff and they said they could not ud to Las Vegas that night but the day after. They wouldn't provide a hotel but said they could get me to LAX airport that night and I could make my way to Las Vegas by taxi (at my own cost ). This flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours and I reached LAX at 2.30 in the on 15th leaving me no way whatsoever to reach Las Vegas by 4 am to board my next flight. I had to buy another ticket for my international flight for roughly $900.,Detractor
"  Excellent trip with Lufthansa from Paris to Los Angeles via Munich. The first thing to be highlighted that Lufthansa's cabin crew are always exceptionally professional, polite and efficient. Here, I would like to express my appreciation to the crew which was on 20th March from LAX to MUC as the aircraft had problems with air conditioning system (it was cold like in Antarctica). The Chief Purser (chief flight attendant) was extremely helpful giving extra blankets, offering hot teas and being with passengers all the time.

"  We bought a ticket from Keflavik to Porto via Barcelona. You would expect that the airline would check-in your bags to the final destination, and provide boarding passes for both legs of the flight at the departing airport. But no. They would or could only check-In to Barcelona, with no explanation, other than the system didn't show the second leg of the flight. We showed booking number and email, which clearly states that the ticket is for Keflavik to Porto with Vueling all the way, and not two separate tickets. No further explanation or appology for the inconvenience. At Barcelona airport, we spend about 2 hours, walking out of terminal 1, waiting for bags, check-in and going through security. Just to get back to terminal 1. Lucky that we had this time, which we had expected to use for relaxing, since this was now early morning, after a flight overnight. At the check-in they would or could not provide an explanation and gave no appology. All they could say was to write a complaint. Complaining on Vueling's website is basically impossible. All you can do is call the UK on your own bill. So they might have had a technical glitch in their system, or the check-in guy in Reykavik just didn't know how to do what was needed, which in it self is rediculous. But that does not excuse the total lack of taking responsibility, trying to fix the situation, providing a simple appology or trying to elevate the hassle. I recommend using another airline and will certainly avoid Vueling by all means in the future.",Detractor
Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None.

" Manchester to Barcelona. Read the fine print very carefully. I did not, and I paid dearly. Luggage: included in the cost is what you can fit under the seat in front of you. It appears they purposefully spread your group out in the cabin. For example, I had an empty seat next to me on one of our flights, yet they didn't seat my young daughter and I together. She was in the rear of the plane and I was up front. Seating together costs extra. Technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. Their check-in process is a scam. You will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. Okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. After you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. If you forget (like I did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like I did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket. Here's the process: a) Wait in the queue at check in. The check in person informs you that you owe a fee. She fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. Wait in the queue at customer service. Pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). They fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. You have to take this new form back to check in. Wait for a second time in the check in queue. You hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. Run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass. Again, read the fine print and understand what you are in fo. I recognize my own failings working with Ryanair, but it really seems like their process is designed to cause a certain number of passengers to fail at their game and when you fail, you pay so dearly.",Detractor

Some of the flight attendants have the nasty habit of ignoring passengers and thereby forgetting to bring drinks or meals to some.

TG916 BKK-LHR on Thai Airways A340-600 aircraft. For a 13 hour flight (14 plus 1 hour delay!) seats in economy were incredibly uncomfortable and entertainment box under the seats were irritating. This is a complete contrast to their B747s which although older seem much more comfortable. Luckily this particular flight was half empty so I was able to attempt to sleep on the two window seats. Staff made up for the discomfort. As usual they were very attentive and friendly. Food was a little bland but not inedible. Entertainment was great - the same as the inbound leg which was still enough to last me the full 14hrs! All in all not a terrible experience.

Going from South Africa to Cairo I noticed a guy asking one of the airhostess for water, she was so rude and said can you be patient and let me do my job. I assumed something must have happened earlier hence she was being difficult. I experienced the same thing on my return trip it was a late flight and 4 year old wanted water as he has water before he sleeps. I asked one of the airhostess could I have a glass of water for my son. She walked up and down 3 or 4 times with newspapers and handing other people food and then bringing my special food yet again without water. It took her an hour to bring me a glass if water. This was really annoying especially for a 4 year old child to wait for water. Besides the service most of the seats were broken. My seat was always going back in the upright position on the return flight as well but after the water situation it was of no use complaining to the rude crew.

As for the in-seat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch, the screens use a touch-screen control which doesn't seem very sensitive, meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force - not great if you want to sleep.

Osaka to Helsinki - the flight was overbooked and I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to business class. I would not be able to afford it normally so I was delighted! The highlight was the seat itself and the sense of personal space it created. The crew were attentive and courteous and seemed to respond promptly when I saw other passengers using their call buttons. It feels bad to complain about anything when I was getting a free upgrade but in the interests of objectivity and honest feedback I would have to say that the food was surprisingly bad. If I had paid full fair I would have felt very let down. The menu looked promising but the dishes did not fulfil that promise.

Let me start by saying that I read at least 25 reviews on this site before we started packing. I read about the extra baggage fees. The surprise baggage fees at the gate. The delays. The date changing unknowingly during the ticket buying process (we had to go back afterwards and fix the changed dates). The rude staff. Not being given free food or beverages on the flight. The small seats. We were traveling (2 adults 1 child) from Houston to Minnesota for a funeral. We didn't have time to save for this unexpected event so we flew with a notoriously cheap airline and didn't pay for checking or carrying on luggage. All bags were well within the size limit stated online for their one personal item. The flights to Minnesota and back both went smooth. We were not hassled about our purses and computer bag. Flights were on time. Arrived home 30 minutes earlier than expected which made the kid happy. We took food and drink onto the plane so we didn't have to buy anything from the airline. We co- ordinated our seats to make sure that we all had enough leg room. The flight crew were excellent.

It is mandatory for FAs on China Southern flights to ask passengers whether they would like to be woken up for meals in case of falling asleep but it was not the case on this flight. I fell asleep indeed and woke up on landing announcements. Requested the meal, the purser reluctantly served it saying ""you have to be quick!"".

The in flight meal is fine, though there is room for improvement. As this is a short flight, snack box was served with 2 choices of Korean delicacies. This aircraft is fitted with the old In flight entertainment (IFE). The number of movies and music selection is rather limited. Asiana should consider enhancing the IFE with higher density (HD) screen and adding number of choice of entertainment into the IFE. I would conclude overall experience is pleasant one.",Promoter
"  Hamburg to Accra via Lisbon. The business class is low economy class standard. My knees touched the next seat, not much option to recline the seat.

Only positive was the food and small bag with slippers, sleep mask and ear plugs.",Detractor
 Flew Spirit Airlines from Dallas to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline ever with the most expensive fees for carry-on bags. They charged us 200 for carry-on bags. The plane is too old.

The A332 Muscat-Dubai is rather old but who cares for a 45-minute hop, but service is still very good. I also had a free upgrade to First to go with one from Manchester to Dubai on the outward journey, so I guess that increases the feel good factor! The leg to Manchester on an A380 was perfect. The cabin crew were good , service was efficient. A good meal, an entertaining movie, a couple of hours sleep before a light snack and then chauffeur service to get me home.",Promoter

Not reading word for word the baggage policy, as most passengers don't, we were unaware bikes were not allowed unless in a box. The manager and the baggage check in person accused us of Fraud and stealing from the airline. We explained it was not stealing No fraud because we were unaware of of the policy.

Round trip between LAX to MEL on business trip for approximately 16 hours in the economy section at the window (to MEL) and aisle (to LAX) seat with price tag of $2660 USD. Overall experience in seating was not pleasant rather painful experience. 1) Leg room space appears to be one of the smallest of all the planes I have traveled with. This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face. No more Qantas!,Detractor

I have absolutely nothing to complain about on my first Spirit Airlines experience. I know the reputation of the airline however on my trip I was impressed with the experience for the price I paid. I flew DFW-CLE round-trip just a few days after the route started. I took only a personal size item and made sure I followed all the rules to avoid extra fees. The trip cost me $68 round trip total out the door. Flights were on time flight attendants were humorous and nice. I will say the experience was no worse than any other airline I have flown (I fly once every 1-2 months) and given the cost may have been better. This route will allow me to visit family at home in CLE more often. I felt I needed to give credit where it was due given the majority of the reviews for Spirit.,Promoter

" I have traveled several times with British Airways, but only in long haul trips. Those have been pretty good. This time I had to fly from Edinburgh to London Gatwick and I end up with mix feelings. Ground service in Edinburgh was outstanding. Expeditious, friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge. Service on board was average but friendly. Departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very well. The plane was an Airbus 319 in pretty good shape, clean and well maintained, however the space between seats was simply ridiculous. It was extremely small even for a midsize person. There would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work. Happily the person in front of me did not recline, that could have been a disaster. Very bad. Of course there was no entertainment.

YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint.

JFK-Dublin. Business Class. Return leg of previous review. Efficient boarding at JFK for what was a very full flight. Great Cabin crew who did a nice meal service that wasn't too rushed but not too lengthy either giving passengers who to get some sleep the opportunity. Good Cabin Crew presence throughout the night and they certainly kept the galley noise to a minimum which was much appreciated. Slept well for 4 hrs straight and crew served a very tasty breakfast an hour out of Dublin. Priority bags out very quickly for Dublin anyway and customs a breeze. Can't fault Aer Lingus on this flight they seem to be getting the balance just right on the LCC model. Business Class fares very competitive on this route.,Promoter

Passengers from a flight to Miami, cancelled only that day, were given seats ahead of me! After a harrowing 3 hour wait, I was given one of the last seats just as the plane commenced boarding. Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open. Onboard staff were also quite rude - they appear to hate their jobs and certainly the passengers! Abrupt, unresponsive.

We booked to fly to Lima, Peru through British Airways (BA) and they routed us on Iberia (IB) going via Madrid as they done do Lima direct.

"  Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just don't take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyone's time.

"  London Heathrow to Xi'an return via Beijing. I would never use Air China again. They rescheduled two flights, one before we went and another before we returned.

They had to get us new flights back to London, mine was via Paris and my wife and stepdaughter had to go on a separate flight via Madrid. The reason for this they told us was they couldn't get us 3 seats together on the same flight. Later my wife told me she saw at least one guy sleeping across 3 seats on her flight, so this was utter rubbish. Total time to travel door to door coming home was almost 40 hrs - ridiculous for a journey that should normally take 24hrs.

" Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver. Our flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas was severely delayed by over half a day, so we were offered flight vouchers for the value of $100 each with Spirit Airlines. At first, we accepted, this sounded great! However, it's impossible to use them. Spirit Airlines travel vouchers are not compensation. They expire within 1 month. You cannot transfer them. You cannot book under another name. You alone MUST use them. The flight vouchers only remove the flight portion of the ticket. You cannot combine them with miles. You must pay for an expensive ticket to use them. The flight portion of the ticket is actually really low. On a cheap flight, it can be negative, which means you cannot use your flight voucher at all. Other times, it can be $5 or so. I called customer service, they suggested picking a $300 flight rather than a $40 flight so I can use my voucher. You have to pay extra fees. The vouchers didn't arrive by email, but we did get an email saying we were entitled to our vouchers. We had to call their number to speak to 3 people to have them issued. The guy on the phone had a horrible accent and it took us 40 minutes from phone up to phone down to get them. Their customer service phone number is impossible to navigate.

"This our third time flying Air Canada Rouge and they seem to be improving. We were in Preferred seating 17 A/C. The flight attendants were professional and attentive. We noted some changes to the uniform which was nice to see. There is no entertainment system and one has to download the AC app., or pay for the use of an IPOD for $10.00 which is really a waste of time as there is very little worth watching. Our prepaid snack was just OK, nothing special. The aircraft is really showing its age. The carpet on the floor was very dirty and lifting in our area. Gum noted on the floor in our seating area.

Both flights on-time with good food and competent crews. The only bugbear is you'd think with a crew to guest ratio of 3-1 that it wouldn't kill the crew to do a few water runs inflight. The return flight had Etihad crew supervising so maybe the Alitalia crew will no longer (famously) spend the entire flight behind the galley curtain.,Promoter

"Flight from ADL-MEL is only a short flight but flying with a premium airline like Qantas Airways is the way to do it before christmas to make sure you get to your destination. Check in was easy, with the new procedure of enter details in via the accessible computers available to customers. Printed out boarding passes and baggage tags and took bag to bag drop counter. Very easy. Airline boarded fast, row 26D, good seat. The new addition of the in-seat tv's are great. Select anything you wish for, and used the in-seat messaging service which was great with a friend sitting 4 rows away. Was a lunchtime flight, shame no wines only softdrink and juice or tea/coffee but meal was good. No complaints as seat was comfortable and well padded given I have soft tissue injuries.",Promoter

ZRH-HKG-ZRH in Business. Outward journey was fine the single seats are a nice touch although the inflight entertainment needed be reset a couple of times. Food excellent and good selection of wines. The staff on board were very good but the return flight was excellent. Smiling staff for a completely full Business Class section the 'throne' single seat again very comfortable and the massage function rather nice. No problems with entertainment and a good nights sleep. The food designed by the Peninsular Hotel was very tasty. I appreciate that these A340s are getting a bit long in the tooth but they are due to be replaced with B777ERs. Having said that and whilst there are not the gimmicks of other airlines SWISS have got the Business Class product really good. For 12 hour overnight flights I was impressed and think they are good value. Cathay have just started this route again but the SWISS product is top notch and to be recommended.,Promoter
"  San Diego to Fort Lauderdale. Worst customer service. Cancelled my flight 7 hours prior to departure and this happened late at night so I didn't find out until I went to check in online on my way to airport. They couldnt get me another flight until 3 days later so I had to pay $300 for a new flight home. They told me they gave me a voucher valid for a round trip for inconvenience when I went to use it it was only worth $50. Spent 2 weeks calling them about this and every time it was a different story. All the representatives are like robots. Like they have had the most impersonal customer service training ever.

A380 flight from JFK - Dubai - Kuala Lumpur early in December 2013 with my wife and 3-year old son. 1st leg: JFK- Dubai-KL. On the JFK - Dubai route they flew the A380 which was nearly full. It was an 11 pm flight - the crew only began to start serving food 4-hrs after take-off! My son did not receive his complimentary inflight toy set they did give the toys out but ran out before reaching us. Always had to do a 'reminder' request for water or drinks! Dubai - KL route: they flew us in a very old A330 - flight was cramped and the seats smelt! The surface of my seat was worn out and torn. The air-conditioning and ventilation wasn't working before the flight and performed poorly in the air. Return leg (KL - Dubai): The A380 plane blacked-out when the plane was boarded and engineers had to come on board to fix the problem. During this time the plane was dark very stuffy no any offer from the crew to provide drinks. Lots of apologies from the captain though but the flight was delayed almost an hour.,Detractor

China Southern Airlines provides a relatively cheaper flight from UK to New Zealand, with the benefit of the relatively new, more comfortable Boeing 787s.

I tried to check in online but I couldn't find the ticket and when I call them they said it's canceled and you should call us. Then I asked him the flight is about 7 hours no time what to do? He told me to pay 1500DH if I want to come by that flight. I told him it's your mistake, they said you are right but we can't do anything for you. So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn't got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH.

"Boeing 767 on the way to Vegas and A319 on the way home. Boeing 767 decent in terms of space. Although we managed to get the exit row so I can't really judge the legroom in the regular seats but ours were great. Width of seats also great. Although we couldn't put our personal item (purse) under the seat so that was kind of a pain. A319 seats are decently sized in terms of width but the pitch is below industry standard. I rode the entire overnight flight with my knees pressed firmly into the back of the seat in front of me. I am only 5' 7"". My boyfriend who is 5'10"" found the trip excrutiating. The seat only reclines 2"" so impossible to sleep. The onboard crews on both our Rouge flights to and from Vegas were excellent - friendly, helpful and pro-active. On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an ""over that way"". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics. I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers? Even when the flight is purchased entirely with aeroplan points it's not worth it.",Detractor

Every time I fly with Spirit Airlines there is some problem. This is the last time that I'm flying with them. Spirit Airlines doesn't care for their customers at all. Delays all the time. You pay for your carry on bag more than the regular bag (of course you don't have one free bag at all). If it's going like this soon we'll be forced to pay for our personal items as well. I will not fly with them again.",Detractor
The whole experience was bad. The purchase of the ticket then the purchase of a seat then to have to pay to carry my briefcase onboard then the charges for a bag to be carried on were higher than checking a bag and finally the lines at check - in were very long and slow. It felt like a 3rd world country government owned airline. The website was not user friendly. The seats were very uncomfortable. The one positive comment that I can make was that the flight staff was very nice and had good customer service. The whole experience was rinky dink. I will go out of my way to avoid Spirit.

"  Baltimore to Juliaca via Miami and Lima. I wish I could say that ""I will never fly on American Airlines again"" like some reviewers, but the truth is, with mergers and consolidation it is difficult to do this. This was a trip to Peru, with the flights split between American and LATAM airlines. Three legs of the trip were on American and three on LATAM. The comparison was not good for American. First of all, of the three legs, two of the planes had mechanical issues which led in one case to have to switch planes and the other to sit on the tarmac for an hour. The longest flight was from Miami to Lima on a 767. It looked and felt old and worn out. The seats were pure punishment. They were not the new ""slim line"" seats, but were worn to the point of being hard. The legroom was poor, and I'm only 5'6"". I can't imaging what a six foot tall person had to endure. There was no in seat entertainment, just the drop down screens in various locations. We had a chance to alter our trip plans, and it would have been convenient to change our return trip to leave from Cusco instead of Juliaca. All other legs of the trip would be the same. American could do it for an increase of $7,500! They said the flights were full, and we would have to fly business class. We pointed out that we were holding economy class seats on two flights, so they couldn't be sold out. The response was, ""That's our policy."" I will do whatever I can to avoid them in the future.",Detractor

We took a flight from Manchester to Toronto on the B767. After reading the reviews on here before I left I expected the worst. I am over 6 ft tall and so asked at check in whether they had any extra leg room seats available. They did and I was placed there free of charge. Once on board I found the seat was a bulkhead by an emergency exit so although I couldn't stretch my legs straight there was more space than other seats. My friends hadn't requested extra legroom so we're sat further back in the plane. I went and joined them for a small time (plane was half empty) and the space was no where near as bad as made out on here. Ok space is tight but the cabin felt open and refreshed. Food and service was ok but felt they were a bit stingy with the drinks (only serve soft drinks and only brought round twice) plus no water served in between. Having said all of this I wouldn't like to fly on here should it be a full flight so would try not to use them again unless it was the only option.,Passive
My family and I along with 184 other passenger were all in the understanding that our Sunwing direct return flight was a direct flight from Punta Cana to Edmonton. However Sunwing purpose held back this information from everyone's itinerary on the whole flight. Why stop in Hamilton? 1) More effective us of their flight crew (same flight crew can not do Edmonton to Punta Cana return) 2) Air cargo from Dominican very lucrative for the carrier 3) Southern Ontario to Edmonton cargo market lucrative for Sunwing. This stop added 2.5 hours onto our flight time and not one passenger de-planed not had prior knowledge of the stop over. Nothing but a cash grab at passengers expense an insult to our intellect!

I recently travelled with Air China over the Christmas period from London Heathrow to Sydney via Beijing and back again a couple of weeks later. The flights were around Â£600 cheaper than I could find with any other airline so I took a chance with them. I couldn't seem to check-in online prior to my flight but check-in at the airport and boarding all went smoothly. The planes were clean and comfortable enough and the flight attendants regularly offered drinks including beer and wine. Although there was not a huge range there were a few decent films and TV shows to choose from for the in-flight entertainment. I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty. The food was a bit hit and miss (some of it I couldn't eat and I'm not usually a fussy eater) so I'd suggest taking some snacks.

"  Reykjavik to San Francisco. WOW air is awesome until they have a delay, or flight issue, which apparently happens often. We flew with them a few times previously. Everything was all well and good, until our flight back to the US from Reykjavik. Not only was the flight several hours late, which caused many of us to miss our connecting flights, but WOW did nothing to assist those of us stuck at the airport. No vouchers, no offers for hotel, nothing. The staff had attitudes when we went to talk to them. They hung up the phone on people. They also messed up our luggage. I know that these things can happen. However, every single other airline I have flown with that had a large delay, has assisted with making a situation that we didn't cause, an easier one. It was a nightmare: we were stuck in San Francisco for 2 days, and ended up flying back home on Southwest (all on our own dime). The customer service reps kept saying that the managers were gone for the day and they couldn't give us flight vouchers because they needed approval. They also refused to give us their names. What airline do you know has management that does not come to the office for 2 days straight, especially one of those days being a business day? We noticed that we kept getting the same customer service representative when we called. When we asked was she the same person, she lied and then gave us the same no managers around speech.

"One of the worst airlines. Flew China Eastern Airlines from Delhi to Vancouver via Shanghai on January 9th. Flight cancelled from Delhi for no reasons. Got on to the flight next day. Old plane with no TVs on Seat, no alcoholic beverages. Flight Attendants rude. Arrived at Shanghai at midnight, was told that I will be able to catch 13:30 flight next day - but that never happened. Waited two days to arrive in Vancouver. Spent hours at Shanghai airport and of the worst travel experiences of my life. Avoid this airline.",Detractor
"Check-in at EDI much improved on last year. Flight departure on time. Crew on first sector EDI-DOH seemed a bit unco-ordinated on my side of the central aisle. The all day dining concept did not seem to be properly co-ordinated. Food is served, but without wine at the same time. When I requested a glass it never arrived. I consequently left my main course untouched. Although my partner's meal service was better on his side of the aisle, he only received his glass of wine after he had finished eating lunch. Arrival in DOH allowed for sufficient time to shower and have a drink and snacks in the Business Class lounge. Service on the DOH-BKK sector was infinitely better, but as I had opted to sleep, I only ordered a cheese course, and could sleep for the remainder of the flight. Have to mark down based on EDI-DOH staff performance.",Passive

The premium economy cabin is spacious and one of the most comfortable premium economy cabins I've had. Business had great capsuled flatbeds. Wifi was stable and available during the flight except from the Chinese airspace. Food and drinks were tasty and good.

2nd time flying with Etihad and found that the seats are getting smaller legroom disappearing and squashing in as many people as possible into the plane. Very disappointing and uncomfortable flights.

She was texting me while being stuck for a total of 6 hours in the airport that no one from Frontier really gave updates in a timely manner or seemed to care. They just had people sitting there for hours waiting! Also, why would they not have a crew? And if they knew they'd need a new crew, why weren't they called in advance? Frontier is cheap for a reason! I wasn't too happy that my 16 year old waited in an airport by herself for 6 hours!!",Passive

My hand reached from my seat to the one in front of me and I don't have big hands. Service was lackadaisical. I asked for coffee but was told it couldn't be served as the seat belt sign was on which is understandable.

Rouge is not recommended unless the price is really great.",Detractor
"  Avoid Air Canada if you are 1) traveling with kids or 2) you don't want to buy brand new luggage or 3) you want a difficult check-in process. We booked tickets 8 months in advance and they couldn't find 4 seats so my family could sit together. Also, during the beverage service on a previous flight, the beverage cart skipped my kids row and served the adults around them instead. On each leg of our journey, the gate agent complained about our carry-on luggage - specifically that our 22"" carry-ons (aka industry standard) didn't fit in their convenient 21.5"" size requirements. Southwest is 24"", other airlines are similar. I've flow this bag all over Europe and only on Air Canada is it an issue? And then the check-in fiasco. I attempted valiantly to check-in the night before, but that didn't seem to work. Electronic boarding pass options? Nope. So we arrive at the gate and guess what - none of the kiosks work either. I scan 3/4 passports, then the machine decides to quit working. Even discount airlines figured out how to have proper check-in procedures at a fraction of the cost. If you value your sanity, wallet, or are traveling with kids - every other airline is a better choice - stay away from Air Canada.",Detractor

"  The phrase 'you get what you pay for' broadly springs to mind however, you do actually ""pay"" in all senses. Cheap flights bonus, pay more for selected seat to sit near family ok however easyJet will try to get you close anyway, more to get on priority understandable, Â£45 fee if your app doesn't work and you don't have a paper copy of your boarding pass. Flight itself chaotic. No one takes bags at the gate that are meant to go in hold for free resulting in everyone trying to get cabin bags on then moaning when there is no space. They pack you in, close the doors then tell you there's a delay, passengers sat making phone calls, messaging, texting at every possible opportunity throughout the flight but that's ok. They keep every possible bright light on during the entire flight (we flew overnight) so no chance of sleeping in their slimline chairs that even I struggled to get my legs comfy in and I'm only 5'6"". Then they decide to put seat belt signs on, for no apparent reason before turning them back off and bringing the trolleys out. So no one can actually go to the loo because of the trolleys and the 2 staff taking up the entire aisle! Seriously, would it not be easier to do this with the belt lights on? Return flight meant to take off at 22.30 so all lined up with gates open at 2200, but with no warning, no information given were left standing around to board just after 2240. Queues chaotic, people in priority that shouldn't be but let on anyway so everyone else left with backs and legs aching, kids crying and tired because the staff don't seem to know what they are doing. Followed by yet again a late night flight that's lit up like Blackpool tower with everyone doing as they please. Can safely say there is probably less torture endured by stowaways!

"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again.",Detractor
"They say the cheapest things end up being the most expensive, except in this case it wasn't that cheap to start with! on our Wizz Air journey to Budapest the board said gate will open in 1 minute, suddenly changed to 30min delay. At the new time it was meant to leave it finally gives you a gate. Walked to the gate. We weren't boarding, we were just being hulled into a tiny room when the plane had not arrived. We were there like cattle, no chairs, everyone really close together for about 40 minutes! We saw the plane land and people disembark. We finally boarded, already running 1.5hrs late. Then we sat on the plan for a further 1 hr 20 minutes- due to ""busy air traffic"". There was no communication, just insincere apologies and not even a soft drink as compensation. We considered getting the Wizz insurance for the return journey in view of this experience but all you get in return is Wizz Air credit and we had already decided that never again with Wizz Air, and also didn't think it could get worse. We were wrong! Return journey 3 days later. Flight originally on time, gate to open in 1 minute, gate opens B4. 3 0secs later delayed by 1.5hrs. This then increases to 2.5 hrs. Then it changes to please go to voucher desk. No one is at the voucher desk they asked us to go to. All the passengers are now through to an area that only has one shop and an upper crust so there is nothing to do. And no going back to the main area with all the shops and restaurants as we needed to pass a further security check point to get to this unmanned desk. Finally 25 min after they asked us to get to that desk someone arrives with no info, but a Â£5 voucher for food. He explains there is no Wizz representative in Budapest and he is not sure why there is a delay but thinks it's weather related. Food runs out from the upper crust as that's the only place we can use the voucher. Board changes to boarding so we head to gate. We were lucky to have managed to get some food - however, when the status changed to boarding, people were still queuing up for the voucher in the most inefficient process ever made. Once again, boarding did not mean boarding. It meant being huddled into a cold shed with no chairs, waiting for the flight to arrive and disembark. It ended up taking off over 3hrs after it should have. I was shocked with how inefficient, how uncommunicative, how disorganised Wizz Air was. **NEEDS EDITNG DOWN",Detractor

Keep in mind that this was at 09:47 am which is 1 hour and 43 minutes prior to delayed departure time. We go the help desk and the one agent didn't get to us until 10:02. She was rude when speaking to us. Instead of the normal bumping and compensation, I think that easyJet turned it on the customer under the â€œonline checkin closes 2 hours prior to scheduled departureâ€ clause. It does not specify on the email airport counter closes at that same time.",Detractor
"  Washington to Johannesburg return via Amsterdam. I chose KLM for this trip because of an extremely attractive price offered at the time of booking. The price was so good I upgraded to Economy Comfort which I believe is worth the extra cost. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I deplaned and set about exploring options for occupying my 3-hour layover. After using the facilities and finding an open seating area for some relaxation and online activities, I discovered that my cell phone in its clip-on holster was missing from my belt. Panic set in an I retraced my steps and searched wherever I had been. I checked in with Lost & Found and while sympathetic and very helpful, they did not have my phone. What a depressing start to my safari adventure. I resigned myself to the likelihood that my phone was gone and I'd have to pay to replace it upon return to the USA. I boarded my connecting flight and had just gotten settled when I was approached by one of the flight attendants who held out an object in a plastic bag and said, â€œI believe this is yours.â€ Life was good again. The phone had come un-clipped sometime during the first flight and fallen between the seat and the outside wall of the plane (I was in a window seat). The cleaning crew found it and turned it in along with the seat number where it was found. KLM staff researched the flight manifest and found my name and then looked up my itinerary and determined the next flight I would be on and forwarded the phone to the flight attendants on that flight. Now, that's what I consider service. Thank you KLM. I would also compliment KLM on the food and staff service. Both were great.

Ok I'll make arrangements. However as the night progressed we were informed again that there was a longer delay. At this point I realized that we were being lied to and I didn't appreciate hat at all. The lack of consideration to those of us waiting was obvious.

"  San Antonio to Portland via Denver with Frontier Airlines. This review might be different than others in the sense that I was unable to even go on my trip. I was supposed to fly out of San Antonio. I got to the airport an hour and a half prior to departure with my electronic boarding passes from the Frontier app, as instructed when check-in done last night. I followed the sign that said ""drop bags,"" since I was pre-checked. I waited in line for approximately 25-30 mins, while realizing there was something wrong because only agent was taking at least 10-15 mins with each passenger. When my turn came (40 mins prior to departure) I was informed flight had been delayed to 3pm , and possibly 4pm since plane had not left Denver. I would lose my connection to Portland. I was told I would not make my connection in Denver today, so I could take their next flight, tomorrow afternoon. I was supposed to attend a national conference in Portland the next morning. They could not place me in Portland until the following evening. There was no assistance to place me on another airline's flight because as was told ""we have no alliance with any other airline."" My only option, get a refund and look for another flight myself. The ""refund process"" was started but I was not given a receipt because I was told, ""the email was sent, and once they approve it they will send you an email with information."" This is supposed to be within the next 7-10 days, I was informed. I was given a screenshot as receipt by the rep, who voiced being the manager on site, but who wasn't willing to give me his name, because of security reasons? I was unable to fly another airline because my other 2 options (late night flights) would cost me U$500 one-way. Needless to say, I went home extremely frustrated and sad at the lack of empathy, ethics, or responsibility from this airline. Not to mention the many other cancellations I had to do because of this irresponsibility.

"  Abu Dhabi to Manchester. A very average business class flight on Etihad. The A330 had a dated look and the business cabin feels cramped when its busy, as was the case on this flight to Manchester. All seats feel narrow but aisle seats are to be avoided as aisles are very narrow and you are likely to bumped by everyone who walks past. The crew were ok, not particularly warm or friendly and there was no personalized greeting from the purser or cabin manager. Food was okay. Better than on the flights to Asia, but with apparent cost cutting from previous standards. The tomato soup tasted like tinned and the beef cheek was ok, but not business class standard. The supposedly ""ripe boutique cheeses"" were a joke. A wedge of tasteless cheddar and very unripe and flavourless brie. I had a steak sandwich later which was ruined by a huge piece of gristle which I almost choked on. Etihad don't have separate boarding for business class passengers so you have to queue up in the airbridge with everyone else. On a positive note the flight departed on time and arrived early, helped by a heavily padded schedule.

LHR-DXB-LHR. First flight on the Emirates A380. Compared to B777 seats were wider but legroom felt the same. Flight was quieter and smoother than B777. Check in in LHR was good with no queuing and friendly staff. Check-in in DXB no so good 20 minute queue with certain locals known to Airline staff being allowed to jump queue. Check in agent did not smile once. Boarding on both flights very efficient with no queuing or crowding on aircraft or airbridge. Service on outbound flight no so good no drinks served until after meal only one trolley drink service and no breakfast or food before early morning 6.30am arrival. Long wait for trays to be collected. Service on return better with drinks service before and after meal and light afternoon staff. Again long wait for trays to be cleared. Adequate number of toilets on flights with no significant queuing. In flight entertainment superb with good quality screen let down by poor control sensitivity.,Passive
"  Miami to San Francisco. Never have I experienced such delays for no apparent reason other than the flight was late to begin with - they boarded us two hrs late, as soon as the prior flight de boarded. Bathrooms filthy, no beverage service, other than warm water. After boarding they notified us that we would be sitting in the plane for another two hours. Not a full flight so we found some seats to stretch out in, as soon as I got comfortable in my new seat I was informed that I had to relocate to my original cell of torture - again, for no apparent reason. The attendant begrudgingly gave me warm water as if! Suffice it to say, I will avoid flying this airline at all costs.",Detractor

"  Kansas city to Ft Lauderdale. This airline does not even deserve 1 star, unfortunately that is the lowest rating available. I will never fly on Spirit Airline again! When we first booked the tickets we thought we were getting a good deal on the price. Spirit Airlines nickel and dimed us for everything from the seats to the luggage. We had 2 of the smallest checked bags (which were the same price as the carry on) and the cheapest seats. We had one lay over there, and one on the way back. We had to pay for seats each time. By the time we paid for the bare minimums the trip cost us as much as it would if we had gone through a good airline such as American or Southwest. We needed to change flights more than 4 days in advance. Spirit tried to charge us almost $600 more! Yet the flight time, duration, and miles are the exact same for the day before and the scheduled day! The airplanes were dirty, outdated and uncomfortable. Customer service is rude.

From boarding to arrival an exceptional experience with Air New Zealand from YVR to AKL. Comfortable seat both in upright and fully flat configuration. Pleasant cabin ambiance with cool colours and fresh looking environment. Food choices were ample and my fish was prepared just right.

FA's were nothing short of outstanding with smiles all around even after 14 hours in the air. IFE had a rich library of movies and music. Flight departed and landed on time.,Promoter
"ORD-NRT C Class. FA's would go out of their way to cater to requests and the needs of passengers. It's not too often that you would hear a ""sorry no"" from them. And if the answer happened to be a ""sorry but no."" it would be followed by ""however perhaps we can do this..."" and would be followed by an alternative solution. The seat while not fully flat was comfortable enough for the Transpacific flight and decent entertainment options on the AVOD. Lavatories were frequently cleaned by the FA's and fairly decent sets of amenities were made available to C Class passengers. Second (or third) meal service anytime by request is great since you can eat at your own timing. Lobster Curry was tasty. Excellent ground staff service both at ORD and NRT.",Promoter
"  Another unpleasant flight with Vueling from London Gatwick to Barcelona. It started off with an announced 45 minute delay some three hours before the scheduled time. As seems to be the habit with Vueling, boarding only started when it was already time to depart. No explanation or apology was offered. Once on the plane, the cabin staff rushed everybody to please get to their seats quickly in order to minimise the delay. Everybody complied only to then find nothing happening for almost another hour. No engine start, no air conditioning, no water provided and once again no explanations or apologies. After more than half an hour waiting in a hot cabin, a few additional passengers came trickling in, then later some more. So a passenger behind me asked a flight attendant what the heck was going on and what or who we were waiting for. The answer was barked back at him rudely, saying we were waiting to pick up more stranded passengers from other flights Vueling had messed up. He then ridiculed the complaint saying it wasn't in the airline's interest either to have the plane sitting around idle and we weren't doing this for fun. Again not a trace of an apology or even comprehension that the airline might be failing customer expectations. Ultimately we arrived in Barcelona after midnight which left most public transport options unavailable and most passengers were forced to take expensive taxis home. The only apologies ever offered were part of the arrival announcement and rambled quickly into the PA mic. Tight seat spacing, the limited choice of reasonable quality food and drinks and the complete lack of entertainment or connectivity options were as usual on Vueling, special observations. When in control of the booking, I'd prefer almost any other low cost carrier over this one.",Detractor
"  Boston to St. Louis. Avoid this company if possible. I purchased tickets online for business. I paid the insurance fee, an option provided BY American Airlines. Due to a snow-storm I needed to reschedule. When I tried to reschedule, I was only permitted to delay by a few days. I wanted to wait until the following week, and stick to my Mon-Fri schedule instead of arriving mid-week. They would not accommodate me this way. I could only reschedule within a limited time-frame. Any other flight at any other time would be full price. When I informed them about my insurance, I was told they don't actually have any, and I must contact the insurer directly, even though they haven't told me who that insurer is. All I could do was cancel the flight. Even though I opted for the insurance, certain flights are non-refundable (mine) so they should not have allowed the system to offer me insurance. Now that the flight is cancelled, even though the took my money, I didn't even get any mileage credits, and they will no longer provide me with a receipt so I can be reimbursed by my employer. This company has built-in anti-consumer policies, are dishonest, and likely to scam you through what they consider standard practices.

"  Paris to Toronto via Reykjavik. Okay the price was right, the planes are new and flight attendants were gracious. But be ready for flight delays - up to 6 hours in our worst case. The lost baggage customer service at WOW is totally ineffective! Our bags were lost for 13 days. The friendly-enough baggage customer service people basically just said what we wanted to hear but no real idea where the bags actually were - we were being lied to. 13 days of multiple phone calls waiting from 40 min to 2 hours to get through to customer service. First the bags were found still in Toronto, then Iceland, then Paris then being still held up in Toronto Customs? There is no reason or desire for Customs to hold outbound bags as confirmed by a phone call to Customs. Throughout the whole time we were told our bags would be delivered to our home, so after an additional 3 days of our bags at the Paris airport the bags were delivered only as far as the Brussels airport when we were told to go pick them up - a â‚¬30 train ride away. Upon pick-up it was a last straw that one of the main handles was completely ripped off the bag - grossly mishandled to be in this condition in WOW air's care. Putting in a claim they very quickly came back with a response and a lecture about it being only minor damage and wouldn't affect the usage of the bag? What? You mean the main handle you use to put it in the trunk of your car, up/down stairs at airports, onto trains etc. The fact that it was unsafe to use because of the shards was totally lost on them. It wasn't the retractable handle, or a wheel, or a heavy bag that they used as justification to deny the claim. They completely ignored the fact that I had a real out-of-pocket expense for the train ticket. Continued correspondence with them is just completely ignored except for an immediate auto response that the email was 'noted'. Even the auto responses are irregular",Detractor

"Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barbados on May 12th. The worst flight of my life! I am only 5'2"" and I have to say it was tight for me. The seats recline about 4 inches in total. When the person in front of my seat reclined the back of the seat was in my face! I felt sorry for the fellow in the window seat who was over 6' tall. I really don't know how he managed for the 5hr plus flight. His legs were stretched out the entire time so that he could fit into the seat. 2 guys behind me were hacking and coughing for the entire flight (not the fault of Rouge - but they should have worn masks or not be allowed on the plane). The staff was great and were cheerful throughout the entire flight. The overhead luggage bins are smaller than those on other planes. Then I discovered one of the reasons the bin space was further limited was that the crew had at least 3 of their bags in the bins so the paying customers had even less space for their items. I hope that reviews like this will be taken into consideration and that Rouge is not used on flights to Barbados. Also the seats were hard and uncomfortable. For 2 days since the flight my back and neck have been in a terrible state. I will not fly Air Canada again between Barbados and Toronto until more comfortable planes are in use.",Detractor
"â Unverified | Our recent trip was from Sydney to New York and return. The A380 on the SYD-LAX-SYD route made a long-haul flight very pleasant. Meals were of good frequency, size, and quality. The self-serve drink and snack bar at the rear of the aircraft is a good idea and was well-stocked. Crew were friendly and worked hard. The LAX-JFK-LAX sectors were operated by refurbished 747-400ER aircraft, and although the flights and service were fine, the 747 is starting to show its age. Noise levels and (dry) air quality are noticeably different to the A380. Our return flight out of JFK was delayed due to the crew being caught in a traffic jam en route to the airport. Apart from that delay the flights were very good. The mix of good service, value-for-money, and what I consider to be a more-than-adequate economy class product means that Qantas remains my preferred carrier.",Promoter

Very good overall, with the usual attentive and friendly service by cabin crew combined with, on this 2-year old plane, a very comfortable seat - helped by SIA only having 9-abreast seating on the Boeing 777-300ER. Seat back screen (Panasonic) was very generously sized and gave a clear picture, but the instructions were far from intuitive. Even with good headphones, film dialogue was often hard to follow, but after trawling through the buttons trying to select a sub-title option to compensate I gave up and called for cabin crew help. The steward took several minutes to find the magic button, but was himself too confused to explain how he'd found his way to it. That apart, the entertainment selection was extensive and even when the passenger in front reclined her seat the TV screen tilted enough to enable comfortable viewing.

"Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option.

"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubaiâ€“Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks â€“ wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter â€“ they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Detractor

"  Worst airline experience of my life. We were flying from Las Vegas to Cleveland. Our flight was delayed 4 times in perfect weather only to be cancelled at midnight due to crew being timed out, something which an airline should be able to know about several hours before the flight. They were anything but helpful in booking hotels and new flights. You have to do that all on your own. Never have I had to do that when I've had canceled flights in similar situations. Also, Frontier could not get us to our destination for 2 full days. They only reimburse you a set amount, which we went over, and you have to front the cost. It cost me $2700 to fly and house my family, $800 which I will not be reimbursed. I spoke with customer service and they did not say anything that their generic form letter didn't already say. They did not reimburse our difference and had no resolution to the situation. I will never be flying with this airline again.

"  Orlando to Las Vegas. During the check in process we were informed that the flight was cancelled. We were notified via email and text approximately 1.5 hours prior to departure. The airline offered no reasonable alternative flight pursuant to FAA rule 240 to offer alternative transport to our destination within 24 hours. The customer service rep made some vague comments about purchasing tickets and trying for reimbursement. We were then offered a flight out of Tampa into Denver to connect on the morning of 7/24 to Boise, where we would rent a car and drive the remainder. After these tickets were booked, we were informed that the connecting flight was actually scheduled to depart the night of 7/24. Since this would not work we made arrangements to fly to Salt Lake City the morning of 7/24. This change cost us over a thousand dollars of unnecessary expenses and included spending the night on the floor at the Denver international airport with our three children. Upon boarding the flight on 7/24 we remained at the gate until approximately 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time. At that time we were deplaned due to maintenance issues. I feel that the extremely poor management of this airline is directly what led to these issues and left my family to spend large sums of time and money to make up for Frontiers obvious inability to run a functioning airline. The airport is literally full of people that have been left delayed and/or stranded by this airline. This sort of treatment is wholly unacceptable and needs to be addressed.",Detractor

This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did.

" I flew from Oakland direct on the dreamliner to Copenhagen Sept 8th, returning on the 21st from Stockholm, again direct on the dreamliner. In between I flew 3 other times in Scandinavia on Norwegian 737's. I have to say that I was fairly impressed with the service I received. Check in was easy at each airport. Service attendants both in the airport and on the plane were friendly. ALL 5 flights took off on time and we're uneventful. I do not usually check luggage, but my carry-on was going to be a little heavier than their restrictions so I paid the lowfare+ fare. This gave me seat assignment, a meal and one checked bag up to 20kg. Norwegian did not lose my bag on any of these flights and the luggage process was quite efficient. My friend accidently checked her bag to Oslo instead of Oakland. I was staying on in Oslo and saw her bag when I went to get mine. I immediately took it to the Norwegian service desk and the employee actually ran the bag to her flight! It was the first one off in Oakland! I would have to say the food and entertainment selection were just average. The window shade and continual air were cool on the plane: seat size average. Pricing was great! Overall, from these 5 flights I would rate Norwegian an 8 out of 10.",Promoter
" Singapore to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. I fly to Asia on business 5-6 times a year and Turkish Airlines has always been my preferred airline. Until I got stuck for two days at IST airport during the military coup 2 years ago. But that's a different story altogether. I now tried Turkish Airlines again on a business trip to Singapore and could not believe how much the airline has changed to the worse. The planes on all 4 legs return was old and worn (don't know the type), old and smelly blankets, the food was by far not what it used to be, uncomfortable seats, totally unorganized transit lanes through customs, which nearly caused me to miss the onward flight. Staff was nice and friendly though. Unfortunately, I have already booked another business trip to Shanghai in July, but this will be the last one with Turkish Airlines. Back to Emirates again, which are way better in every criteria and not much more expensive.",Passive

Flight 1901 on June 3rd and I was very disappointed. 1) There was no free entertainment if a passenger did not have their own device for accessing the internet using the plane's WiFi. We were charged $10 CAN to rent an ipad. 2) The overhead reading light did not work for my seat. 3) There was no individual climate control (overhead cool air blower) available in economy class. Therefore I found the cabin temperature quite warm and uncomfortable during my 11 hour flight. 4) The emergency exit lights on the floor which the cabin crew referred to prior to take-off were not apparent. This was cause for concern about our safety in the event of an emergency evacuation. 5) The movie/music selection on the rental iPad was limited and unsatisfactory. 6) No magazines or newspapers were offered to passengers prior to take-off. This was disappointing in view of the long 11 hour flight. 7) The cabin crew were polite but rather unprepared inefficient and immature. They ran out of orange juice while serving beverages and I had to wait until the next beverage run hours later in order to get my beverage of choice. 8) There was no video flight map available on the airplane and the captain failed to provide periodic verbal communication to the passengers regarding our whereabouts. 9) No fresh towelettes were offered to us prior to meals. Thus I was obliged to get up and go to the washroom to wash my hands prior to my meals. This was not ideal given that the cabin crew was in the isles serving passengers. My overall experience was extremely poor and I shall never fly Air Canada Rouge ever again!,Detractor
Heathrow to Washington A380 upper deck club world return. Crew fantastic aircraft clean seats comfy food excellent both ways. Cannot pick fault with anything apart from they advertise 50K as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out of a window from this seat.

The Heathrow product is 100 times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference in standard of service and product delivered.,Promoter
"  Zurich to Tel Aviv. I have never experienced such a lack of leg room. People were arguing throughout the flight, because people's knees were already scraping the seat in front, so if anyone moved, they caused discomfort to someone else. The worst 4 hour flight I have had. They show you a safety video before you take off and it is unrealistic to believe that anyone in economy could have done half of what was mentioned in the video. The man in the photo was probably about 5 ft 5 (165 cms) and he had no leg room whatsoever. If you are going to cram people into a plane to such an extent that they can't move, then the seats should not be adjustable. No way would I fly Swiss again.",Detractor

" I was sitting in row 3 on both flights, Brussels to Reykjavik and Reykjavik to Miami. For the first time I have experienced flight crews that limit the use to passengers of the forward toilet. An absolute never-again moment for me. There was a gaggle of cabin attendants continuously in the front galley of this A330-200. They did their normal thing in the cabin and spent a lot of time eating and drinking and chatting behind closed curtains. Before take-off the lavatory lock was set to closed (normal procedure, lifting the tab and closing the lock) but I noticed that the red light in the cabin remained red for a long time, well into the cruise phase of the flight. I assumed that unlocking the lavatory was somehow forgotten so I got up to ask and go to the toilet. I was told by a cabin attendant that the lavatory was â€œinoperableâ€. Which is not a word a cabin attendant will voluntarily use. â€œUnserviceableâ€ maybe, or â€œbrokenâ€. I got back to my seat and started paying attention to this. With no inflight entertainment I had plenty time to do this. And what happened? From time to time the lavatory occupied light in the cabin went from red to green, then back to red, and so on. The lavatory was being used. At the same time, every passenger who came forward to use the lavatory was told to go to the back. Each and every one. I'm actually really upset by this. The cabin attendant who told me that the lavatory was â€œinoperableâ€ lied to my face. If for some reason WOW has a policy of limiting the use of the front lavatory for (flight) crew only, then so be it. But then be open about it and do not lie to me. After the flight I had the urge to wait for the captain to appear from his cockpit to congratulate him on having such a strong bladder because during the almost 8 hours that they have been in their seats, not once did I see either one of the flight crew making a trip to the back of the aircraft to make a lavatory visit. There was no need of course. They had their own â€œinoperableâ€ lavatory. Else: Poor in-flight food / I find the meal choice a very slim one for a 7.5 hour flight. Also weird that on my first flight I was given 2 meals for both flights (â€œthis is how we do thingsâ€ said the cabin attendant on my first flight). Then on my second flight I was given another meal. Now I had three. Cabin on board not clean/comfortable / The cushion of my big seat was flat and loose. The big seats don't have enough pitch, and I could not use my laptop when the passenger in front had his seat back in my lap. Poor service on board / My biggest gripe on these flights. While the WOW PA is not bad, certainly better than most I've listened to and funny at times even, the cabin crew really is not interested in the passengers, other than milking money. They spend as much time as is possible behind their closed curtains (front) unless a passenger needs something (which means buying something) and then it's all smiles and â€œhow can we help?â€. Poor in-flight entertainment / So I found out that one either brings their own device or can rent an iPad. Lost opportunity for WOW there, assuming they understand about aircraft connectivity, sales channels and the further benefits this may bring in aircraft operations and customer information tracking.",Detractor
Flew Business Class from NRT to BCN (via AMS) in seat 4E of the updated 747-400 aircraft. Besides this plane being ancient and the fact that I felt sorry for all the people by the windows with no direct aisle access I had a terrifically smooth flight. I had heard about and seen photos of odd dishes served but not on this flight. All food throughout the flight was delicious plentiful and served on interestingly designed dishware. Previously I experienced some plastic items but not this time. The AVOD was OK but did not have as recent offerings as their partner Delta and the quality of the large screen was milky. The seat was surprisingly soft and was comfortable in any position including lie flat. The toilets were cleaned throughout and FA were always available in the galley with smiles. The FA were remarkably genial and good at their jobs. There were two toilets dedicated to all of business class and I never once saw an economy passenger try to enter. Overall I loved my flights. The connection on a 737-700 was more of the same with continued good service and food though the intra-Europe seats are not that comfortable.,Promoter
"  I flew Air Europa from Valencia to Sao Paulo via Madrid. Upon arrival in Madrid at around 9.30 pm, flight to Sao Paulo was scheduled for 11.15 pm. We are notified that the aircraft would be late, no reason given. There was a bit of a riot being created at the gate with an exchange of nasty words between passengers and Air Europa employees. Finally, due to pressure from passengers, close to 1 am, they tell us departure will be 7.00 am. The airline refuses to provide hotel accommodation, instead they send the 300+ passengers to a shared airline lounge. When the 300+ passengers arrive at the lounge, there was only one employee to greet us and she needed to check everyone in one by one. Each passenger seemed to take 5 or more minutes until boarding passes and passport numbers were recorded manually. People were left waiting in line for about an hour or more. I was one of the first to get in, but there was already nowhere to sit, people were lying on the floor. The lounge offered some drinks and food which quickly vanishes and never gets replenished. Coffee machines are out of order. We spend the night there. We board at around 7, we don't take off until 9. We are given the reason for the delay from the captain: ""the plane was late coming from America last night"". After 10+ hour delay, we take off. Plane was old, lavatories were not in a good condition. Food was poor. The way back: flight from Sao Paulo leaves slightly late. We arrive in MAD ahead of schedule, however, at 5.00 am. Long story short: my 7.05 flight to Valencia is cancelled and I was put on the 14.30 flight, which is, what a surprise, delayed - we don't take off until 17.00. They did offer me a hotel for the layover, which was nice. But the rebooking process was as follows: had to exit the airport and go to the customer service desk at check-in level. There was no sign that says ""Air Europa customer service"". Nobody knows where it is, employees gave me the wrong directions. Customer service gives me a voucher for the hotel, but are incapable of printing a new boarding pass. I have to stay in line at check-in to get one. I make it back from the hotel at 13.00. Monitor says ""delayed"". Finally, a feisty employee was insisting that I check my small bag, because ""it won't fit under the seat or overhead compartment because the plane is small"". I asked if it's an ATR 42. She says ""yes."" I say, I've flown that plane before and my backpack will fit. I keep my backpack, it fits with no problem.",Detractor

" Jakarta to Tokyo via Beijing. Air China was the cheapest airline for our flight to Japan. Check-in process was perfect and boarding procedure commenced very organized. Cabin crew greeted us with smiles offered help to passengers who needed assistance to place the carry on baggage. As for inflight service, the crew showed some dedication. Seats were okay for first hours during flight, however after second to final hours of flight, the seat could not provide enough comfort and lumbar support to rest (unlike for example SQ or EK which adds much comfort to their seats). Meals were fine although they were not perfect. Drinks were served. In conclusion, Air China is for passengers who seek low cost flights with full service. As for transiting in PEK, I should say transferring passengers must be ready to endure the complicated process before boarding to your onward flight.",Passive
Having flown the very long haul JFK-HKG flight (15 hours) with the newer reclining seats and the older shell seats on short HKG-MNL flight (2 hours) the newer reclining seats are uncomfortable and have no privacy. The shell design seats were more comfortable between the two. The newer seat design reclines six inches right onto your knees if you are an average sized person. So much so I had to notify the flight attendant to instruct the person sitting in front of me not to recline fully because I literally could not move. This is inexcusable. The seat pad is so thin the underside of my legs began to ache in an hour with a genuinely painful posterior another hour later. There is little privacy with these seats because the seatback tops are small and have space gaps between them that put the AV screen in the next row in your line of sight. It is even worse when the person in front reclines. The miniature storage caddy below the AV screen is handy for storing glasses small documents etc though it protrudes a bit too much into the personal space in front of the seat. All-in-all these seats were poorly designed and tested and very uncomfortable for long haul flights. The recline needs to be reduced to 3 inches more and better padding is needed for the seat cushions and adjustments needs to be made to reduce the protrusion of the seatback in front of you into your personal space. The storage caddy sticks out too far the seatback pocket area as well. The rails that attach the seat to the plane on the floor are not positioned for seat comfort either. The fixed shell seats HKG-MNL were more comfortable because of the pseudo leather material covering them. Also the top of the seat was fuller giving one more privacy from the AV screens and passengers sitting in the next row. It seemed like they had an extra inch of pitch compared to the newer reclining seats but that may be just because of the limited simpler seatback design (no storage caddy). Food all the way through was average to below average. A fifteen hour flight ought to have three meals rather than the two they served. In the many hours in between meals there were few snacks and they disappeared quickly and were not replenished. The snacks were highly salty such as the heavily blanched peanuts. Several bags of them almost made you dehydrate. They did not taste right. I made the mistake of ordering a kosher meal on one segment and it was very bland and had stiff tasteless crackers. The one that had salmon had been pilfered so they returned it for a regular meal. The seatback AVOD needs to have more classic movie selections documentaries etc. It is also too difficult to navigate the AVOD screen and one often has to press the touch screen several times to get a button to take. Service on the flights was above average. The flight attendants and pilot crew were professional efficient and pleasant. While they were very busy the flight attendants were responsive as they could be in such a busy atmosphere. The gate agents were pleasant attentive to detail and efficient. All the CX we encountered were above average in their professionalism and service. If it were not for very uncomfortable seats and their lack of privacy and the below average food and inadequate snacks the service would lift the experience to 4 of 5 stars. CX needs to customer test the seats and food and improve them to be a four or five star experience.,Passive
" Extremely poor site and service. Experienced a system issue with the Wizz Air site that disallowed me to proceed with an online check without an assigned seat. Tried on various computers/mobile devices and ilnet connection to no avail. It was definitely an issue with the Wizz Air site. Turned up to the airport early to explain this to the Wizz Air customer service desk and still had to form out a 32.50 Gbp fee for a printed ticket. The fee is steep but understandable for those that forget to print their ticket. I feel I should have had the fee waived given my circumstances. Raised an online ticket for refund asking them to check my log data for my login attempts to verify system issue experienced. After no update from Wizz Air I contacted the listed UK number for existing bookings found on their website only to be told I contacted the wrong number. I offered to direct him to he website advising of error and he simply replied ""look man, I know that's on the site but this only for people who need assistance"". Extremely poor site and service.

Flew SW from Denver to Philadelphia on 7 September. Flight was delayed by an hour due to weather in the Philadelphia area but we were kept informed of changes which was good.

Seats are very comfortable with adequate legroom certainly as much as any other airline in economy. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight.

"Alitalia flight from Rome to Los Angeles, and the aircraft were outdated and seats ridiculously cramped. There is no wifi onboard and no plugs for computer or phones. But the worst part of this airline was customer service. At our check in at Fiumicino airport we were greeted by grumpy and rude staff. We had been told by phone that with a doctor's letter my mother could have a more comfortable seat as she suffers from arthritis, we got the letter and even paying for it, they could not secure that seat.

"  There is almost no customer service. My young children and I intended to fly from London Heathrow to Mallorca via Duesseldorf at the end of May. When it was clear that the delay to the first flight would mean we would miss our connecting one, I got fobbed off 3 times at Heathrow when asked to book another connecting flight. We didn't get coupons for a meal while waiting for the first flight. I couldn't rebook another flight on my own initiative as I had checked luggage. Don't worry, I was told, they will take care of you in Germany in any case. Well, there had been some weather issue and a security issue at a close by airport: there were at least 500 people in a queue for 2 customer service people. Back to front of hall and around food courts. People said they had been waiting for 5 hours and more. Some of them said I had to go back in to retrieve my luggage. Airport security and baggage then told us our bags were on their way out. Wait by gate 1. We followed up regularly with the baggage person, but by 10 pm, 5 hours later, no luggage. I took my kids to a hotel and by early the next morning flights I had booked myself as there was no one on phone or in person. My luggage was lost for nearly a week and each contact with the airline was time consuming, one agent was outright rude.

"  Miami to Toronto. This is the last Rouge flight I will be taking. Unfortunately, as Air Canada expands its Rouge line and destinations this will likely mean simply switching airlines for many flights. Although flying Air Canada has never been cheap, one of the things they always had going for them was that the leg room and comfort of the economy cabin was a step above many US and European airlines. Not so with Rouge! This is the most cramped cabin I have travelled in. 3+ hours of having my legs firmly pressed into the seat in front of me is uncomfortable and unacceptable. Rouge was a big mistake for Air Canada. This is Air Canada's 80th year of service and they are trying to expand their international presence.",Detractor

Cabin staff at SAS are generally very friendly and service minded. The new SAS Plus (C-class) is however a greatly degraded service compared to the previous Business Class. To my opinion even the former Economy Extra was much better. In SAS Plus you are served (free of charge) a limited choice of cold sandwich or a cold salad i paper boxes with plastic cutlery. Exactly the same choice is offered in SAS Go but then you have to pay for it. There is no longer a free middle seat in SAS Plus.

"This is the fourth time flying with Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to San Jose, Costa Rica and my first review. This is a very uncomfortable plane to ride in, especially if you are a larger than average human. I always pick a window seat when I travel because an aisle seat puts me midway into the aisle and am constantly jostled by people and or carts throughout the trip. Thank goodness my wife is small so she takes the middle seat and I take the window and we make it work. Bottom line is the seats in the Rouge fleet are just too small and too close together. I cannot sit down without putting one leg into my wife's designated area as the seat in front is too close and on business trips where I am flying solo, I am much more cramped and even at that it is very difficult to fit in there and it is infringing on a stranger's personal space. The seat is also very narrow and uncomfortable (hard seat cushion) and also there is no entertainment centre so a 5 hour flight seems like an eternity. For future travel I will book with a different airline if possible. I don't mind the regular Air Canada planes and will happily fly on them but Rouge will be my last choice in the future. I typically fly for business five to six times a year and for leisure a couple or more times per year so on average take a flight about once a month and usually a three hour or more leg is involved at least twice per round trip.",Detractor

"Pleasant flights with easyJet. We had purchased emergency exit row seats, and had speedy boarding, which made the boarding process stress free. It was good to see that in Palma, even though a bus was needed to get to the aircraft, speedy boarding passengers were released from the bus first. I was impressed by the attention given by the cabin staff to ensure that the exit rows were kept free of bags, shoes etc. The best of the European low cost airlines as far as I am concerned.",Promoter
Just flew Melbourne to Bangkok on the way to London business class. Had flight times changed so now sitting in Bangkok lounge for 7 hours. Seems that Thai have various planes with different seating and it seems a bit hit and miss as to whether you get lay flat bed type seat. We flew 777-300er and had flat beds. However very narrow and hard as a board. Staff pleasant as we boarded 11.30pm went straight to sleep so only had breakfast which was ok. They use Air New Zealand lounge along with Etihad in Melbourne fairly ordinary from food perspective. Thai Bangkok lounge better but again pretty boring in the food stakes. Would probably not use the flybuisnessforless tickets again as there seems to be no flexibility and now we fly to Dusseldorf and then on to London so you have to question if saving a $1000 is worth having flights changed with no comeback to over 35 hrs Melbourne - London travel time no points and not knowing if you are going to get flat bed seat. Old adage you get what you pay for I guess.,Promoter

" Dallas Ft Worth to Houston. When we arrived at the airport (after our driver being pulled over which took time) we still had one hour before departure. As I have never flown on United before, I didn't know the procedure. We went straight to the baggage drop and told them we're getting late, instead of informing us to go to a different kiosk to check in our bags, they referred us to the monitor. And while we were trying to check in the monitor said to see an agent, (which was ONE agent in the corner which was somewhat helpful) but his supervisor was so rude and mean and didn't let us even talk. I didn't expect someone at a supervisor or management position to act this way. Do United not give supervisor training to their managers? I was very disappointed and our whole vacation mode was ruined. Now I'm waiting at the airport and will have to wait for another 4 hours.",Detractor

We were offered a sweet on take-off, drinks throughout the flight and a free meal - all rarities these days.

But all in all a fantastic experience.",Promoter
"I travel by Air India quite often, it has records for delay in flight always. But this time I had a bad experience and i have decided that I am never going to travel in Air India again. My flight was from Bangalore to Silchar via Guwahati. I was supposed to change my flight in Guwahati. But due to delay in flight as usual, it decided to go directly to Silchar without changing. Captain made an announcement about that. But as all know, maximum people usually don't hear the announcement with full concentration, I heard it but still to confirm about that I went to ask Air India staff, he just shouted like anything, saying ""Can't you listen announcement has been made?"", like me most of the passenger went to confirm about that, he shouted at everyone.

The toilet was very easily accessible and clean as well. The flight attendants were very friendly and approachable, and service was superb. Food served was excellent as well.

" Boarded plane and waiting for a quick de-ice so we can get underway, storm expected in Omaha. Crew pulls back to gate and re-opens to let late passengers on. Then pull back out, now snowing heavy in CO and we have to go through a full de-ice. Huge delays and very frustrating. Especially, since we rushed once from a connecting flight and they had just closed the gate. Plane was still there but we were told it is against Federal Regulations to open the door once it is closed. Guess we were lied to. Flight prior to this one was to ATL for SuperBowl, due to engine trouble we had to wait a til the next day to fly and missed out on some events. No accommodations made, just â€œnothing we can doâ€.

"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented.",Passive
"Flew Norwegian from Gatwick to Dubrovnik on the 15/06/2016 returning on the 25/06/2016. The flight out was excellent - welcomed by crew, had snacks, free wi-fi and arrived over 20minutes early. The return flight no welcome, and on going to our seats somebody was sat in them, there was a cabin crew member stood there who said nothing, it was the person sat in our original seat who told us to into the row behind as he had a prosthetic limb, and could not sit in the emergency exit seats behind surely this was the cabin crews job to tell us about this. Shortly into our journey we had a bit of turbulence so the seat belt sign came on and stayed on a very long time the turbulence only lasted about 10minutes. Eventually the trolley service started and when it reached us in row 14 no sandwiches left.

The personnel is entitled, condescending and rude, treating customers like inconveniences. Not to mention that they charge for everything. I've tried to remain with them out of loyalty to LAN and in hopes that they might show the high quality of customer service as they did in the past, but I believe it's time to move on.

YVR-HKG-MEL in Premium economy. On balance a bit of a mixed bag experience. Seats definitely an uptick from economy but the fundamental problem is cabin design which is flawed - the cabin feels like a retrofitted afterthought which it is. On the B777 YVR-HKG leg the one toilet in premium economy is in the right front of the cabin necessitating anyone on the left side of the plane to crawl across the four seats in the middle front row to access it. That isn't well thought out and isn't a nice thing to do to the people sitting there and is difficult at night with all four people stretched out sleeping so the alternative is walking back into economy down the left aisle which is a hassle. On the A330 HKG-MEL there is no premium economy toilet which requires a trip back to economy. Food seemed more 'economy' than 'business' but to be expected really. The other big negative on the YVR-HKG flight was the premium economy cabin was filled with upgraded passengers due to a massively oversold economy cabin. I would estimate 80% of the people in premium economy were upgraded and not for status reasons which makes the logic behind paying for it hard to justify. On the positive side Cathay service always shines and the crews are professional and efficient.,Passive
LHR-BAH 26 December. Skyteam lounge in Terminal 4 is good a little tatty perhaps but the buffet was decent. Self-serve champagne and a decent selection of very cold wines. Flight was pretty ordinary. IFE is poor - half a dozen films on a loop with rubbish image quality so they have started handing out personal media players which are preloaded with a dozen movies and music etc. The standard of service was very good - real care and attention to detail. Food excellent - turkey for Christmas champagne served throughout. Planes are pretty tatty and the prices no better than Emirates or Qatar Airways so even though staff get top marks and the food was good I would never recommend Gulf Air over these two airlines.,Passive
We flew TRF-SZZ and return in July. The plane was on time both ways and we were generally pleased even if security at SZZ on return flight was dreadfully slow. When flying Wizz you are truly on a budget airline but it works and you get what you pay for. We carefully read the luggage rules in advance and avoided paying extra that some of our colleague pax had to do. Seats are OK but if you are XL (like me) you should consider buying a seat with extra leg room. One concern is safety: crew permitted passengers to leave their seats during taxi. Not acceptable.,Passive

" Singapore to Jakarta. I fly this sector on a weekly basis with Garuda Indonesia. What the airline has going for them are the very friendly and helpful flight attendants, reasonably comfortable seats for the 1.5 hour flight, good benefits for their Gold and Platinum tier frequent fliers (lounge access, priority boarding, priority check-in counter, additional check-in luggage). What they need to improve on are the in flight meals (repetitive and no change for long periods of time), repetitive on board announcements (starts with the flight service manager going through exactly what is found in their safety briefing video) and the lack of bin space for carry on luggage (this one is the result of an overly lenient policy on passengers allowing oversize and multiple bags).

"Shanghai to Dunedin via Auckland. Unacceptable. Bumped from first international flight with instructions sent by email to obtain update on the phone - only a local number was given (and I was on hold forever). Last flight leg ultimately canceled. Sitting in the airport - first it was 15 minutes late, then late due to medical emergency, then late due to engineering problems, finally cancelled. Foreseeing this as the process unfolded, I asked if I could be put on another flight (there was one, it was not full). I was told that Air New Zealand had ""a team"" working on it, then (snottily) that ""premium"" customers would come first. At the end, big scramble at the gate with no apparent rhyme or reason about who was rescheduled (I was not). They cannot field a plane, but staff are able to be rude. Other flights were also cancelled while I was waiting (engineering problems). Many angry people here at the airport today. I previously travelled on Air New Zealand more often for work, and I have to say, this domestic flight scheduling/delivery problem coupled with rude ground staff seems to be more frequent than the on-line statistics that I see suggest. My overall rating is a 2 because of staff inability to deal with frustrated customers in a calm and supportive manner (rather the opposite).",Detractor

I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.,Passive
"Flew return flights from Birmingham (UK) to Newark in December 2015 with United Airlines. Plane was 1 hour delayed leaving Birmingham due to issues with luggage being stored in the hold however no announcement was made by the crew until 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The cabin crew on the way to Newark were rude and lacked basic customer service skills, even a smile and eye contact seemed to much. Rather than offer drinks, the trolley was swiftly marched down the aisle not stopping unless you caught their attention. My entertainment screen was also broken when I asked one of the female crew members to look if anything could be done I was told no and she wouldn't do anything. I understand it wasn't the end of the world as I had a book and my iPod but found her response unhelpful. Food was okay for airline standards and seats had a reasonable amount of legroom although we had upgraded to premium economy. On our return journey I was shocked at the rudeness of the staff at check in, we were using the self check-in system at Newark which I found clever and fast however the United Airlines attendant assisting passengers showed some of the poorest customer service I had ever seen, I'd advise not to ask for any help at this stage to anyone using the United Airlines Self Check in at Newark. The overnight flight back to Birmingham though was far more pleasant, it shows the difference a nice crew can make to your journey. Overall I wasn't massively impressed with United Airlines and probably would not use them again if it came to it. It's a shame the efforts of some staff members are overshadowed by others.",Detractor

They called us at the gate about an hour early and they gathered all the passengers in the rather small gate area where we had to wait quite a long time, which was rather annoying. Boarding started and I was the first on the plane thanks to speedy boarding, which I think is really worth the extra money. I was initially worried that boarding would have been absolute chaos but in the end the staff at the gate were very professional and the boarding procedure was really organized. The cabin crew and both pilots were extremely nice and friendly and the atmosphere onboard was very relaxed. Food and drink isn't too expensive and they have a really good selection.

There is surprisingly plenty of legroom in economy class and seats are quite decent and comfortable with USB charging and places to put your things. The check-in process in Sydney was fast and staff were friendly, although the booking class I booked did not entitle me to pre-book seats at time of purchasing flights, I was able to choose seats a couple of days before when on-line check in opened. On board staff were also friendly and efficient, food served was tasty and there were a few options to choose from and staff went through the aisles often enough to provide drinks when needed.

Premium economy return to Paris transferred at Guangzhou. This is not premium economy compared to other airlines. Other than priority check in and boarding the seats food service entertainment was identical to economy. As soon as the seat belt lights went off a number of passengers walked into premium and sat down not to be moved. The food was almost inedible and wine undrinkable. Personal entertainment systems were ok but only present for 3/4 legs. The other leg had a shared screen which played half an English language film then two Chinese films whose subtitles could not be read. Seats barely reclined and loud passenger announcements came frequently and spuriously such that sleeping was near impossible. There was very little English spoken and a general reluctance of staff to assist or provide any service above the mandatory meal services. This was my first and last trip on CSA.

" Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Etihad was once perhaps the best airline in terms of service, value, food, in-flight services, and miles program. After years of loyal service with Etihad, I can honestly say they all of these once great features have become degraded to the point where I could rate many budget airlines better in every feature than that of Etihad. Only recently I had an issue whereby they increased the amount of guest miles required to make bookings to most destinations, and this happened to occur whilst I was making two online bookings, and happened a day earlier than it should have. After many back and forth emails and calls to Etihad, the outcome was that I was to blame, and that I made up the story to try and gain extra miles. They robbed me of 45000 hard earned miles and refuse to acknowledge any fault from their system or at the very least come up with a resolution or compromise. And I am apparently a loyal Gold customer and also a government employee, where we are given privilege treatment. I can only imagine how a ""regular"" customer would have been treated. This is only one of many issues I have faced as their services decline along with their money hungry cost cutting approach to virtually all aspects of their business. It is a real shame. Sadly they assume that customers do not see through their ways, but I can see from the ample bad reviews that customers are not at all happy with Etihad. Perhaps it is time they listened to their loyalty base. I for one will be choosing alternate airline wherever possible - there are many cheaper airlines which have better services now than Etihad.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Taipei. Really disappointed with services from Cathay Pacific. I did online check in 2 days before, online gave no options for kids meal. Finally find time to call hotline and said kids meal needs to be requested 24hrs before, I missed this by 1.5hrs. Talked to supervisor, nothing can be done but heard my complaint. Frustrated but not choice. No kids meal for a 3yr old and a 5 yr old. My flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Return flight also delayed even the flight departed on time from Taipei. On my return very disappointed again. I got response after my post and since I was overseas, I requested to follow up call after my return which Cathay did even thought it was 1 day later than what I have requested. The customer hotline lady and the supervisor I spoke to never mention about using the so called ""manage my booking"" function in the website to request for meal. As a matter of fact, how could I as a customer knows such tricks in your website? I am a customer, not an expert in your website. You should make your website informative to allow me to do so. To continue, my wife follow customer hotlines to online check in for our return trip and not able to find way to request for kids meal. I received call from your complaint staff.

She also mentioned the agent who booked our ticket might not request for kids meal.

"Singapore to Los Angeles via Guangzhou, and China Southern Airlines is a good choice. Price-wise it is very cheap. Overall, the flight time and crew service are very satisfactory. There was no flight delay on our way to Los Angeles (December 17). But, there was a 1 hour delay from Los Angeles to Guangzhou (January 3), while on time flight back to Singapore. The food was nice, with overflowing drinks. Crew were attentive to our needs and they speak English. Me and my family of 6 will consider taking China Southern Airlines again. Thank you for the safe travel we had, which is a wonderful experience for first time long haul travellers.",Promoter
"  Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",Detractor
LH 419 departure on Feb 27 2014. I flew with Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Nice clean and very new plane. I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class). For an overnight flight it is recommendable to aim for a exit row seat since you cannot stretch your legs and the arm rests are firm. The meals and beverages/drinks provided were all very good and did meet my expectations. Getting on and off the plane was fast and efficient. All in all still a satisfactory experience.,Passive
KUL-BAH-BEY. Things better now that GF has introduced their A332 instead of their ancient A340. Seat pitch is a little bit more generous. The 2nd meal before arrival into BAH was simply disgusting - it seems that nobody wanted their sandwich! The meal to BEY was great. Despite Gulf Air's inconsistent quality I find crew professional and dedicated. Their fares are also an attraction for me.,Promoter

Nice touches provided like a liquor and espresso with meal, hot towel before meal. Cabin is separated and feels spacious. As it is separate there is also plenty of overhead luggage space. Food was good. Price was also very reasonable maybe 15% higher than what i would expect to pay for an economy ticket on this route.

When I got to the counter we were informed that our tennis racquets were beyond the height limitations at Spirits and that I would have to pay $55 and have my racquet checked. My friend has to pay extra as well. So I paid $208 one way to fly to PBI. All other airlines that I have flown allow us to carry on our racquets. My friend flew back to BOS on Feb 8. She paid online to check her racquet. When she boarded two passengers had their racquets on board as carry ons. Needless to day I did not fly Spirit back to BOS.,Detractor

"  People who complain about Spirit are people who are looking for a full flying experience. Spirit was cheap, and if you properly take your time to read, you would see that if you pay online for your checked bag or carry on you save money and if you print out your boarding pass at home takes 2 minutes and saves money. Take an empty water bottle if you don't want to pay $3 for water. You don't have to pay for a seat if you let Spirit randomly assign where you sit when you print out your boarding pass. I fly alone so this isn't a problem. And if you want to sit beside a friend/family member, seats are only $8 to guarantee you sit together. Unless you are a very tall or wide person, the seats are completely fine. There's no movies or Wifi but take a book to read or play a game on your phone. The plane was extremely clean, the staff was friendly and willing to help, flights were on time - some even leaving a little early. Boarding was pushed back slightly but the plane still departed on time (actually a few minutes early). Bottom line: if you are looking for a cheap and clean way to get from point A to point B, I 100% recommend flying with Spirit.",Promoter

I did purchase a seat FLL to LGA which was $9 extra because I didn't want to sit in the middle of a 3 seat aisle. Seats were comfortable, no need for recline for a 2.5 hour flight.

Although their flights are cheaper up front, they found a way for me to pay another $175 to check a bag (I did this a day in advance) and pick a small middle seat in the back. They charge a fee for every seat you pick, they charge a fee for printing boarding passes. Checking in is complicated. You must create an account and provide your email so they now send me spam.

" We were delayed coming out of Vancouver on Feb 23 due to a snowstorm. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for 3 hrs waiting to de-ice, so a total of 8 hrs on this plane on this flight. I do not have any issues with the delay, this is weather related and out of anyone's control. However we had one drink the whole time we were on this flight and they ran out of food. So basically 8 hrs on a plane with one drink and no food. The service starts at the beginning of the plane and works it's way to the back which takes a long time for those sitting at back of plane. As well I had to ask for my drink 3 times after I paid for it, and each time they asked me what I had ordered. Once we connected to the ramp in Toronto it was another 50 minutes to de-board the plane and another 35 minutes to get luggage, as 4 flights were all on one baggage carriage to come through. Overall I found the service terrible, the snack I was able to get also was terrible and did not find a friendly experience overall with any of the staff. My coworker who also was on the plane rang for service several times no one ever came. I have travelled with Air Canada several times and for one reason or another there always seems to be an issue. I decided to write a review this time as I am definitely going to consider other airlines first before I have no choice but to fly with Air Canada. I think this airline needs to remember that ""ecomony"" calls is what supports the majority of the clients that fly with them and need to ensure those passengers are looked after as well as others.",Detractor

Second, a family had their flight canceled or rescheduled. American was attempting to help but the mother refused the offer of a taxi because she requested a carseat (which is understandable).

So the group of us marched to customer service to try to catch the next flight which none of us did. We were all rerouted onto multiple other flights. We were rerouted to Dallas ( this flight they also boarded the entire plane they took everyone off because they forgot to do a security check even know the plane had been sitting there for 30 hours and no one though to do that before it was suppose to fly. ) People missed cruises. My wife and I missed an entire day of our honeymoon by the time we got moved around and reached Cancun it was midnight. All because a pilot didn't show up and they couldn't hold a plane for 10 minutes to allow 20 plus people to make the flight.

In Paris, Terminal 1 Star Alliance lounge is really average service Flight schedule is very good for this flight.

Entertainment system is slow, quite old, and available movies are not so updated. Food is on the good side.

"  Philadelphia to Portland via Denver. My wife and son had the pleasure of flying back Frontier, I hadn't planned on coming back although I did originally purchase a roudtrip ticket that i canceled and they wanted me to pay for a new ticket when i wanted to add the return back onto it. First of all we were emailed 3 or 4 times prior to actually taking the flight that our flight times and dates were changed, we ended up losing over an entire day from our planned vacation. They offered us 50$ vouchers that could be used only (towards purchase of a future ticket in the same persons name) that had no cash value, and had to be redeemed within 90 days, so basically they were useless. We also had to pay extra money for checked bags and were not offered free carryons which was aggravating. They claim you can purchase the works for an extra 99$ per person, per way, which would have been like an extra 600$ for us. However it would have allowed us to get all baggage included and cover any elective changes to our itinerary - in hind sight it might have been better to bite the bullet - heres why : we paid over 100$ for baggage, then when we wanted to changed the name of the 3rd passanger they kept changing the price on us which went up every time we called. By the time we had decided to change the name they demanded we pay a 99$ itinerary change fee a 75$ name change fee, and the difference in price of ticket from original purchase to name change +$598. We were tried making changes online and the website was all buggy, declined our cards several times for no reason - it said we'd paid out over $5,000 for our tickets and would make the same addition multiple times or simply freeze on us. Customer service was terrible even after we obtained guarentee of price hold. I am 6'1"" and my knees had room, backs of the seats were gutted and totally solid - didnt have enough room to bend over and lay on the tray table. We were also forced to layover in Denver for 6 hours turning what should have been a short trip into an all day fiasco. Service was subpar, they offered nothing free except water and their was no option for wifi at all. There were meetings in the back between passengers and crew for one of the entire flights.

My family and I flew United from Austin TX to Portland ME on June 30th. Or at least we tried to fly into Portland. We boarded our flight in Austin and arrived to Chicago with no problems. In Chicago we boarded our connecting flight but were told we were going to have to sit on the runway for a while because of the thunderstorms going on. About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland.

After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. After another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they don't know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to Billund and I can try to catch it, because in that time I had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning. I asked for refunds and they told me that I will receive them within 10 working days. That was in September 2017. I did not receive anything and I tried to contact them multiple times but either I was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my e-mails and complains to different departments.

"After flying with BA long haul for the first time on one of their newer A380s, the flight back to LHR was with their B747-400 which is my favourite aircraft along with the A340-400. Ground service at SFO was efficient. Purchased extra luggage and was still 2kg over my limit on each bag of which the check in agent was considerate enough to let me off. My guess was that the flight was not full as there was virtually no one at the check in counters. I was wrong, the gate was packed. Considering I had 3 pieces of carry on luggage, I wasn't asked to put one of them on the hold. The flight was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Upon boarding, passengers were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in me storing mine some 4-5 rows behind. The seat is no surprise, their older product with the outdated IFE. Cabin temperature was boiling. Passengers were requesting FAs to turn it down a little which they have mid way through the flight when everyone was asleep. The seat pitch on the Boeing 747-400 is 31 inches pitch in economy class. Compared to their A380 product, the cabin felt cramped. Although the seat was comfortable itself to sit on, it just felt cramped. I had the most uncomfortable long haul flights in my entire life., the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn't able to get any sleep at all. I was constantly trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it was impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines. To make things worse, the IFE was very unreliable compared to the A380. I fly with BA frequently on European routes where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the flight times but I would try and not fly with BA's product on their B747s. Inflight meals were rather disappointing. Service was rushed and FA's showed no enthusiasm. First meal was bland roast chicken. Landing meal was an English breakfast considering we were arriving at lunch time. Overall, I would fly with BA again but I would avoid the long haul product offered on their B747-400s.",Passive

 Luton to Larnaca. As Wizz Air customer service told me that the system is trying to seat families together but make the check in ASAP I woke up and done the check in exactly 48 hours before departure hoping to get seats together as buying them would be a rip off. So I checked in and me and my daughter are seating in one place while my husband is seated on a different place and there are many 3 seats together available. Also they made sure the seat next to us was taken so we can't buy only one seat. Also buying extra luggage is so expensive for this flight and we had to rely on the tiny carry on bag. Soon we will have to pay for that as well. So this is not a low cost company anymore. I'm very upset.,Detractor
" Kota Kinabalu to Guangzhou. I arrived at the airport 4 hours prior to departure but the check in process only available 2 1/2 hours before the schedule departure. This load for this flight was low, thus the check in process is quick and efficient. Flight CZ8484 departure 15 minutes earlier as soon as all passengers boarded. Cabin crew are friendly and courteous despite this is a red eye flight. A B737-800 is deployed for this sector. The seat is not equipped with personal in flight entertainment (IFE) but a drop down LED on every subsequent 3 row. The flight attendant commenced in flight meal approximately half an hour after departure. Cold and hot beverages are served. Two choices of alcoholic drinks are provided, that is fine and beer. In view of the low flight load, the cabin service is prompt. The cabin light was dimmed allowing passengers sufficient time to rest. The overall flight journey was smooth and pleasant. There are still plenty of room of improvement when comes into in flight catering.",Promoter
SYD-ICN-IAD return. Unfortunately if you travel from Australia to US via Korea - with a very long layover overnight - you don't qualify for hotel vouchers.

IB6402 Mexico-Heathrow January 4th. I was really impressed by my business flight from Mexico to Madrid. Comfortable cabin configuration on the A340 (1x2x1). Attention to detail on the supplied kit from L'Occitane cream sets to the quality of the fabric of the rug. Very good service: just in time no fuss polite efficient. Departed on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The only point to improve would probably be the list of the movies offered in the IFE: could do better but that's really minor compared to the overall experience.,Promoter
" Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco. Above-average experience on this airline. I originally selected this flight based on price, and was pleasantly surprised. All aircraft clean (including bathrooms) and flights on time. Good selection of entertainment. The only drawbacks were the crew was a bit hurried during the meal service on the international flights. Additionally, two different (senior) flight attendants were not sure what they were serving - one told me she didn't know what kind of noodles she was serving",Promoter
"  This is an all economy airline and if you want anything more you have to pay for it. This airline doesn't make you pay for a share of those seats that are in first class because there is no first class. There isn't a lot of room for seating, hardly any padding in the seats and they don't recline. If you want to snack on the plane you better bring it with you or whip out your credit card cause they don't take cash. The flight attendants were nice and helpful and the flight from San Jose to Houston was uneventful. I don't need all the frills the other airlines offer so for me its just a way to get from point a to point b. Next time I fly with them I will bring something to pad the metal bar in the seat back. We checked our bags and we had to wait probably 15 or 20 minutes longer than what we consider usual after going through customs and immigration.",Passive

First leg Bangkok to Helsinki I was impressed with the A350 and with the cabin service. It was a nearly full flight but meals and drinks were served quickly and efficiently, also in between meal services the cabin crew came round regularly with cold drinks water and juices. The food was good with a choice of dishes on each meal service. I really can't fault the service it was excellent. The second leg Helsinki to London on A320 was a standard run of the mill short flight, 2.45hrs and no meal service but you could purchase snacks drinks. They did offer free water on the flight. Having never flown Finnair I was impressed and would travel again with them.",Promoter

 Atlanta to Chicago. I have horrible anxiety and gets worse when I need to fly. I am a person that believe my feet belong on the ground. Well I had to take a business trip solo and never flown alone. I saw the pilot coming from grabbing some lunch so I approached him to see if he was flying the plane or going home. If he was going home I was going to ask to sit next to him to help with my fears. He was the flying pilot. He asked me if everything was ok and I told him I was very scared and nervous. He told me it was going to be ok and a smooth short ride. I thanked him for the conversation and went to wait in line to board. Well a few mins into waiting a wonderful man came and said to come with him. They allowed me on the plane and introduced me to everyone working on the plane. The wonderful gentlemen told me to pick any seat and he would sit next to me and guide me through the sounds and bumps so I know I'm safe. Everyone working on flight 1599 was so amazing. I wish I knew each and everyone name working that day to call and tell their bosses how much I appreciate everything they did to help me feel better. Thank you so much Southwest Airlines. You all are amazing and I hope your bosses know this. I cannot thank you enough for taking the extra time to help me.,Promoter

"On May 21, 2015, four passengers from my family traveled from Atlanta (USA) to Chennai (India) via EWR and ZRH by United Airlines. We each carried one small carry on bag. The airline refused to allow any of our carry on bag. We were carrying several prescribed medicines and one casual dress to use if there was any unexpected flight delay/cancellation. The airline reps were telling us that there is no space to put any carry on baggage. We begged them to allow at least 1 small carry on baggage instead of 4 carry on bags as we are international passengers and they refused it. They were so rude. They even threaten to call police, if we don't follow their instruction to check in the carry on bags. They were even forcing us to reschedule our international travel to with our carry on baggage. Finally, we did our international travel without any carry on baggage. We make international trips every year for the past 30+ years and United Airlines is the first airline that has forced us to do international travel without a carry on bag.",Detractor
A dreadful experience flying Helsinki to Dubai. Leg room on 757 aircraft only suited for a 5 ft tall person. It seems they took out toilets and added extra rows of seats.

The pilots did very well to inform the passengers and also reduce the effect of turbulence. There were one dinner after taking-off, one breakfast during flight, and one lunch before landing. These dishes were good and the snack was also great. I was impressive by the internet connection during the flight, even over the Pacific. That was a wonderful experience since I can keep connecting with my family, my friends, and others via the internet. For entertainment, there were many latest films and videos, especially I liked the documentary videos. Summary, even though I just flew in economy class, this was a wonderful experience.",Promoter

The new business class seat in AA's 777-300ER is the most comfortable I've had. Slept very well on both flights between LHR and LAX. I was also satisfied with the unexpected angled flat bed business class seat on LAX-OGG-LAX flights in 767-300. Overall I was very happy with their service and products.

"  Epic flights and unacceptable lack of information. Montreal to Nassau via Toronto after being advised by e-mail of a possible delay in flights to Toronto, I was able to anticipate and change my Montreal-Toronto flight for another departing 5 hours earlier. It caused me long hours of waiting in Toronto but at least I could have my transfer to Nassau. Return no email notification of possible delays. Yet the Air Canada AC 1817 flight from Nassau to Toronto takes off 40 minutes late. Arriving 40 minutes late in Toronto, passengers in transit to Montreal were advised that the Toronto-Montreal AC 7564 flight will wait for them, but they must rush to retrieve their bags and return to customs. The suitcases took a little time to arrive but finally, after having recovered them, we were advised that the plane actually had left, without us! It was the last flight for Montreal, the next flight leaving the next morning. Given the late hour (1am when I was rebooked), it was of course impossible to get a room at any hotel to return a few hours later at the airport. So we had to spend the night at the airport and leave the next morning, which caused me a lot of inconveniences. If a delay could be acceptable, it would have been appropriate to notify passengers by e-mail as they did in the first place, in order to allow us to make arrangements. Moreover, it is unacceptable to tell us that the flight will wait for us to tell us 10mn later, after we crossed the airport running with our suitcases, that it actually left without us! This is not the first time that I have been directly affected by Air Canada's deplorable service and I would like to point out my discontent with traveling with you.",Detractor

AI607 Mumbai-Bangalore on January 3rd. Flight was delayed but not so much by Indian standards. Plane was very very old. It felt like going back in time with some seats requiring quick repair before take off. Flight was a little unpleasant also because of the strong turbulence and a bunch of young crying kids. FA's were a little rude at times but always available. One very good thing is that a proper meal is served in a flight that is just over an hour long. While not my favorite I would still use them for flights within India in the future.,Passive
"I am not one to usually write a negative review, however my last 3 experiences with Air Canada have been very disappointing. My partner and I have flown to Phoenix, St Lucia, and NYC all within the last year. We have not had one vacation without a significant delay on either the departure, arrival, or both. Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced. Air Canada has told us on many occasions that they appreciate our business, however they have certainly missed opportunities to show us. We will be reluctant to use or recommend Air Canada again - we require a company we can trust and rely on.",Detractor

Amenity kit is really poor the food is not adapted to the schedule the wine list is not as good as to be excepted (bad champagne served too hot) no business lounges in Doha (for more than 6 months) usage of very bad lounges in Paris or Bangkok. The real good points are the staff and the seat.,Passive
" Started with 1 hour and 45 min flight delay out to Santa Ana. The crew were unbelievably rude. Poor elderly folks trying to catch their connecting flights were trying to figure out what they should do and the advise is this, ""if it were me, I would get off the plane and find another day to fly"" or it was a short and impatient tone. The same crew responded to me in the same way when I asked if they could let the gate of the connecting flight know that I would be running almost a half a mile accross the airport to reach my connection. After running accross the airport and reaching my connecting gate, the guy manning the stand said I'm sorry they pulled the bridge back already, the plane had not even left yet. This was the last flight out for the night which led to me missing an event. The next day, the app made me walk a mile out of the way to the wrong terminal. I finally got on the plane and guess what, the plane happens to be the smallest plane available. To give you perspective, I am 6'7m, the height of the roof of the plane was about 5'8. To top it all off, my flight was 30 min delayed on my final departure. I will never again fly with United Airlines.",Detractor
 Please invest a little extra money to fly any other airline. If you have an issue you already paid your money they dont give two cents.

Sydney to BKK with unscheduled stop at Bali making the trip 4 hours more. I have had a gold card with Thai for about 20 years but I do not think I will keep it. This trip confirmed to me what people have been writing here. This 747 had old rock hard uncomfortable seats from 10 years ago the sound system was broken the menu has not altered for many years and BKK airport is too difficult for an older person. The arrogance of Thai to divert this flight thus making many passengers miss connecting flights or appointments without any prior notice is appalling when a plane could have been sent to Bali from BKK to take on some stranded Thai passengers from another flight without causing more problems.,Detractor

" Pittsburgh to Las Vegas. Grossly misleading with most of the information. I paid for upgrades on seating and baggage and it was only honored on (1) leg of the flight. Then I had to pay additional money for baggage (that was previously paid for and should have been carry on), but I checked it as it was less expensive to pay for checked bag. I could not fight them at this point as my bag would have been held at the city I was flying from. Finally, the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal is that you cannot contact anyone in person. I was told via email to contact the (801) 401-2222 to talk to a human, which I could not find to exist. Also, I talked to the gate agent and she also instructed me to contact someone at that number, I responded that I did and could not speak with anyone, her response was ""Spirit does do things a bit differently"".",Detractor
" After 3 hour delay at airport, flight destined for Verona with arrival time of 21.35, was rerouted to Venice, meaning bus transfer and arrival at 2.30am. We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination. I hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (Â£45) - but I did expect BA to reimburse the 50â‚¬ hotel as a goodwill gesture. Not impressed.",Detractor

Staff at check in said the baggage drop closes at the original,specified time irrespective of any delay to flight - even if announced on website. Fortunately our cases were small enough to go as hand luggage. However my elderly 87 year old mother had oversize liquids, scissors etc which of course were picked up at x-Ray. Fortunately when we explained what had happened the security official took pity and zipped up her case without confiscating the items which surprised me.

NZ734 BNE-AKL 5 Nov 14. Seat only flight good on time good crew IFE fine but no laptop power and buy on board food is poor. I usually fly QF but their plane was full and this was the best bet but it wasn't cheap. While unbundling is sensible the inability to get a decent meal is not. The only way to get a meal is to buy the Works which is not economic for a hand luggage only or day trip passenger. Air NZ is not an LCC so shouldn't act like one. It can do better.,Passive
We (spouse and myself) used AE for a return trip to Cuba via Madrid. Though in most ways the airline was acceptable rather than good or better the food was unspeakably bad. The evening meal was something that passed for pasta - in truth it was a congealed mess not warm and in no way tasty. Breakfast comprised a box with a roll with a tiny blob of butter and a piece of processed meat thrown in. Completely unacceptable. I will not fly them again.,Detractor
Berlin - Lisbon - Sal Island and back Praia - Lisbon - Berlin. TAP has much improved in recent one or two years. Nice onboard service with really good food (actually for Economy standards I might even say excellent food). Flights outbound were on time (as there is also some tough competition for Sal island). Backwards from Praia the usual delay of one hour or so nevertheless flight connection was working. Seats still old and only basic in flight entertainment.

" This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn't complete torture. It's up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I'd say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don't have access to the regular business class lounge but a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn't matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it's open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it's economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I'll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy.",Passive
" Although we managed to check in online for this flight we were unable to select seats for our onward connecting flight to Heathrow with BA. So on arrival at the airport we joined the long queue for Customer Services. After several minutes a member of staff who was questioning people in the queue advised that our issue could be resolved by using one of the Self Service machines. So off to join another queue for a machine to become available. Unfortunately we were we unable to select seats or print Boarding Passes for our transatlantic flight. However we successfully managed to print off Boarding Passes for the MIAâ€“YYZ sector. At the same time another piece of paper was output which stated that we could not print off our luggage tags as the connecting time in Toronto was too short. This despite the fact that the flights were booked over 6 months ago on the AA website. So back to the now longer queue for Customer Services. This queue moved very slowly and the number of agents dealing with passenger requests varied from two to five. Given the length of the line this was totally unacceptable. Well over two hours after arriving at the airport we actually managed to speak to someone who could help us. Our bags were eventually taken from us and tagged from MIA to YYZ to LHR. Once on board the flight was fine and departed and arrived on time. More stress at Toronto as it was not only necessary to pass through Immigration, but also pick up our bags, clear customs and then drop off the bags at the BA desk which had closed. Thankfully, a very understanding and helpful member of staff took pity on us. We managed to get to the gate just as the last passengers were boarding. The bottom line is that AA should never have booked these flights given the unacceptably short transit time in Toronto.",Detractor

But to our surprise when we are flying back to LA, Aeromexico ground stewardess was weighing our carry on luggage together with our personal bags, so obviously all of us are going to have overweight baggage. We explained our side that from LA we didnt have the same problem but the staff are not accommodating. We had a bad experience with this kind of service and probably won't be flying with Aeromexico again. We had to check in three pieces of luggage and will have to wait for it at LAX.

"  Amsterdam to Shanghai. They just started flying to Europe with their new A332 planes, so I went ahead and purchased the ticket. Big mistake. Please do not follow my steps, I am quite a bargain-seeker myself, but no price can justify such a bad experience. During check in my ticket was allocated a ""standby"" boarding pass, meaning I might fly or not. Due to that reason my bags were only checked to Shanghai, despite me having a connecting flight to Manila later. I insisted to check in directly to Manila. Not possible. At the gate I was allocated some random seat (not negotiable), despite willing to pay for upgrade to business, I was told not possible, no seats. Funny enough, some 6 or 7 people got upgraded from economy or standby to business right after me. The worst part was still to come - the seat. Literally, I have never experienced such small pitch in a intercontinental airline, they say it is 31-32 inch but it is not - 29, maybe 30. I could hardly fit in (I am 185cm), with my knees hitting the seat in front. Comparable to Ryanair, but that for a 12h flight. Recline was normal, but the seat moved even further forward - making it impossible to fit the leg straight in the gap between the seats. It was a nightmare. Inflight service was quite slow, staff English level limited, food normal. Mind, they only fill 1/3 of a cup of beverage, ""so that it does not spill"", granting a few walks to the back galley for refills (there is no further service after dinner). Entertainment system works, but there is a very limited selection of movies, which were all dated 1-2 years. I managed to find only one that I have not watched already. Shanghai Airport is big, and of course I had to go all the way through border control, customs and back again to check in to handle my bags 1.5h process, I wonder how that would work on a short connection, Connecting flight to Manila was delayed by 1.5hrs, of course no information or apologies given.

Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos.

We spent hours itemizing our receipts and compiling exact forms per their instructions to submit to the airline (which came to almost 900 Euros with missed connections and changes trying to get our bags). We often had to wait 3-4 weeks per each question or inquiry we made. Every time we called it was ground hogs day, and their employees were incredibly rude. They ended up giving all three of us total $239.00 which is significantly less than even the $450.00 they promised when they initially lost our bags.

Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

This design eliminates most irritation from the one sitting in front. The IFE is excellent, both in responsiveness and content. It provides a sea of Western and Asian movies, TV programmes and music. You definitely would not be bored onboard this flight. The flight arrived on time. The whole flight was silky smooth, almost no turbulence or shaking whatsoever. However, while all are good, the meal is an exception. In this red eye flight, the cold meal was presented in a paper box, not the usual set up. The portion is very small. The taste is terrible. It doesn't get any better if you order a special meal. They are equally pathetic. The drinks that come with the meal is a box of Vita lemon tea which is very sweet. It is good that you can still order other drinks, such as hot tea and water.",Promoter
" Houston to Salt Lake City. The guy next to me was cool with switching with my wife so we could both take care of our kid. Then the stewardess came around and told us the baby couldn't be in that isle because it was an emergency exit isle. That would make sense if it was, but it wasn't an emergency exit isle. When I pointed this out the stewardess got mad, and made my wife and the other person switch back to their original seats. United do an attitude check on your people before hiring them thanks.

ATL-ICN-SGN-ICN-ATL. I would definitely recommend this airline to somebody who doesn't mind about having inflight entertainment which is probably the worst among major airlines. Movies and music are very limited. That said the flight attendants are very attentive and English-fluent. Food is edible sometimes a bit hit or miss. The seats are not so comfortable on A330 since the aircraft is a little bit older. B777 and A380 are much more comfortable. The bathrooms at the back of the planes are often messy. To sum up I'll give this airline 3 out of 5. Since I flew economy class I do not demand much but there's room for improvement.,Passive

Mar 16 2014 YVR-HKG and Apr 1 2014 HKG-YVR - Travel in economy class. In-Flight Entertainment is excellent but the seat is terrible narrow and very uncomfortable. Of all these years I have been travelled with Air Canada this high density B777-300 aircraft is the worst pick from Air Canada. I could tell the crews were not happy about it as they walked by warning us the elbow and leg inside the seat as they always hitting the passengers. I would highly not recommend this route to anyone.,Detractor
I chose JetBlue because I heard great things. I think I had an unlucky streak in which both of my flights were delayed. One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather (out-of-JetBlues control). JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer. They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes. For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often. I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus. Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue. Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer. I respect that and their business model of good customer service. I bet if I didn't have the delays the experience would have been perfect.,Passive
I have used Spirit Airlines often over the last 3 years and am very happy with the company. I go from Plattsburgh to Fort Lauderdale as often as I can and am really happy that I can book trips for as cheap as Spirit puts them on for. I have booked trips this winter in September October November December January and February and all of the return flights have cost me $46.10 each. The plane is an airbus 300 and you feel like you are on a bus. There are no extrast he seats are tight and do not recline but the flight is direct and I manage to bring my own extras as snacks and water and save on the cost of the flight. Instead of having a more comfortable seat with a free drink and a stop over along the wayI get there faster and put the 250 dollars I save on each trip towards lots more fun when I get there. They provide exactly what I want so I hope they do not change.,Promoter

For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful.

"I returned to Canada from Lima Peru on an Air Canada Rouge flight that left Lima at 2.15 am. Air Canada's flight arrival and departure times to Lima have always been inconvenient-arriving in Lima well after midnight, if the flight is on time, and departures for the return flight to Toronto leaving Lima at around 2 am. I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra. For entertainment you can supply your own mobile device and use the inflight service, if you don't have a device you can rent an ipad for $10. The Rouge Premium seats at the front appeared to be marginally superior to economy but come at a steep price differential. To be fair, the crew did their best, although the pilot gave little information with respect to the flight. Never again.",Detractor
For the price you pay for China Southern it is really difficult to complain about them. We travelled on a dreamliner so it was clean comfortable and featured a decent multimedia system. Food was pretty poor even by plane food standards and they ran out of Western breakfasts so we were presented with something that was totally inedible. The staff did serve us first for lunch though to ensure we had a choice. Drink runs weren't overly frequent however you just go and find the staff when you want a drink and it is not a problem. The worst experience for us was Guangzhou airport. All the staff we encountered in the shops / cafes were incredibly rude and miserable and everything is shockingly overpriced. However none of this is the airlines fault. All in all I would fly China Southern again if need be if the price was so much cheaper like this time. They are no Emirates however they don't price themselves to be. All in all a competent airline that I am not too sure why there are so many people giving negative reviews too. Don't pay for a Fiat and expect a Ferrari.,Passive

When I asked why didn't you warn us that we need a transit visa, the lady working at the Check In counter said this: ""I blame you for not knowing this piece of information"". But who would have known we (me and my friend) would need a visa just to transit in Vancouver for 2 hours? Apparently we are not the only ones who were refused to board because of this reason. As a result, we had to pay 200$ each person to go on a different plane. They put us a ""Wait list"" because all the flights were over-booked for 2 weeks.

Everything was shut down by the time we were done with customer service and all hotels were fully booked, mind you its 12.00 midnight, how to get transportation to any hotels - no such arrangements were done by the airline. I did not mind paying for hotel out of my pocket but at least give proper directions or some guidance to help the people who were diverted not only due to weather but also due to low fuel. The hostess was so rude when my son asked for some water and was sent to his seat and told that they would be serving in few minutes.

I am dreading the flight home. We had to wait in Toronto and Iceland plane was late leaving no place to sit in Iceland airport so had to stand for 30 minutes. No boarding preference were discouraged from using the lounge because of distance to walk from gate. No indication on ticket or booking regarding dinner service.

I flew to Istanbul and back in mid-October. It was a short notice trip as such I had no checked luggage so I can't comment on that. My seat was 2A on both legs of the trip. The seat is a normal economy class seat though the pitch is only marginally better than in economy class and definitely much worse than in exit row. Seat comfort was the same as Swiss economy which is to say not great at all. The food consisted of a regional Swiss vegetarian dish and a standard chicken dish with a nice dessert. Portions were small cutlery etc was good though. I paid a fairly low price for my semi-flexible (mid of the range) D class ticket. The value is pretty good if you need to carry a lot of baggage as you may check in 2 times 32kg and carry on 2 times 8kg. In comparison to other airlines such as Turkish airlines business class in Swiss is not ideal. Service quality was unexpectedly blunderous with an almost overly friendly cabin chief and a totally inadequate business class FA who couldn't even recall whether alpha is on port or starboard and was desperately searching for some imaginary economy class guest who may have been lost in business class (why anyone would attempt that on Swiss in Europe is a mystery to me - though it's possible as an accident since the seats in business and economy are identical). Best seats in any Swiss European flight are exit row seats. Have a healthy meal at the airport before take-off and get much better value.,Detractor
" Seoul to Minneapolis via Toronto. Once we arrived at the Toronto Airport, the staff there were so unorganized. They had really bad attitudes & when we asked for directions, the first thing this woman did was questioned us why we were there & told us to go back to the direction where we came from. Coming back from my international destination, when everyone was seated in the plane, it was announced that there were â€œtechnicalâ€ issues & we would have to sit in the plane for 45 minutes. Well, that turned to an hour & half. Even worst was dealing with flight attendants for 13 hours. Our landing was postponed for an hour due to technical issues and the weather condition. Majority of travelers' flights were canceled upon arrival, and the people at Toronto Pearson (Terminal 1) were helpless. There was no one directing people to where they needed to go for assistance. The lines started to get long at Gate 15 at departures but there was absolutely no one to direct people where to line up or answer questions. We waited at the phone line for 1.5 hour just to wait another hour to speak with a representative. Getting impatient, I ended up at the hotel line for 2 hours just to find out it was to book a hotel when we just wanted to rebook our cancelled flight. Once we got to the Air Canada counter, the lady didn't even care to look anything up on her computer & just told us to call this number that didn't even work because it had â€œreach capacity.â€ Basically, the only help most of the 300+ travelers got were from other travelers. Also, this worker came onto the intercom to announce to us that they are doing their best to help us. Following that announcement came some short responses from frustrated travelers.

Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?)

"  Tokyo to Male return via Shanghai. On our way to Male all went smoothly - everything was on time, service was good, food was ok. The plane was new and clean with wide screens. On our way back though the flight to Shanghai was 5 hours late and the reason seemed to be a change of aircraft. All passengers were calm and seemed to be used to these kind of problems. We missed our connecting flight. However we were lucky and had helpful staff helping us get back to Japan on the next flight to Haneda. The staff are sometimes emotionless but helpful. I would recommend the airline but if you want to play safe with no delays and good inflight entertainment, maybe better to choose a different airline.",Passive
" Brussels to Moscow. Not my first flight with Aeroflot. And each time I'm surprised by 5-star onboard service: very polite and attentive flight attendants, always an extra attention for passengers with kids, on board beverages are foreseen for all class passengers, even on very short flight (from Bru to SVO: soft drinks and juice, fresh salad, scone, cheese, butter, bread, warm and very tasty meat or poultry dish, side dish, dessert, tea or coffee - all is tasty en fresh! This is just to compare the ticket of other EU companies who will not serve you anything unless higher class and so much more expensive ticket or on board extra purchases for snacks, and not a full meal). Fleet is super new, clean, again if compare with EU famous airlines. Looks like their high standards of service just grow and do not drop. Concerning the arrival and departure times, all is on time. Even if delayed at a/p of departure due to airtraffic of other (not by Aeroflot depending reason), the arrival time will be same! I can only advise this airline, perfect!",Promoter
Flew JOG-KUL-RGN. Do not spend money on hot seat or pick a seat. Since boarding announcements are in local language first passengers rushed to the gates especially in small airports where there is not a dedicated line for hot seat passengers. When I asked staff at gate if everyone had hot seats they said yes! Pay for hot seats if you want bulk head or emergency exit seats for leg room. At end of purchase the website will give you seat assignments so don't bother paying for pick a seat either. Airplane and attendants are average for low cost carriers.,Passive
You get what you pay for (and sometimes you don't) - they were cheapest across the Atlantic but the seatback video choice was poor and some machines for our party didn't work. But they were the cheapest. When you don't get what you pay for: we booked an Air Europa flight not knowing it was a codeshare flight with Spanair. Spanair went bust on 27 January. We got an email over 4 months later telling us our flight had been cancelled. Unimpressive? I think so.,Passive
Business class round-trip JFK-MAD. The bad: their computer systems reservations and website are very deficient compared to other airlines. Not much information or interactive ability available on English Language website (examples: no seat maps no online check in or even online viewing of reservations). Disorganized: the reason I got to fly business on my return was because they lost my reservation (luckily I had my receipt) and I had paid for an exit row seat. The good which over rode the bad: they made things right with my reservations at the ticket counter and bumped me to business on my return flight. The agents on the phone were helpful and the service on the plane and at the counters was excellent and friendly (though not quite as organized as an American carrier). Good food nice planes (A330). Business seat headrests push your head forward though when in upright position which can be uncomfortable.,Passive
" I checked into my flight via the app with no issue and it had my boarding pass in the app so I could skip the ticket counter and kiosks at the airport. I also paid for a carry on bag in advance. Before leaving my house, the flight was delayed for 2 hours, although the aircraft that was going to be used for this flight was on time and en route in another flight, so that confused me. At the gate, we started the boarding process (I was zone 1 since I had a bag), and we were held on the jetway for a few min because they were not ready to let us into the plane yet. I found this odd we eventually got on. Seats were very uncomfortable and could not recline. Legroom was tight. Cabin staff was very friendly. The plane was further delayed for about 30 min due to a mechanical issue but that got fixed quickly. Eventually we got to Austin and then continued to Denver about two hours late. If you do the research online (bag fees, what's included etc.) On their website BEFORE you book and head to the airport, you will know what you are in for. Most flyers do not plan ahead of time. Most people flying this airline are first time or occasional flyers expecting a first class experience. You still won't experience this on main line carriers either. Being said, you get what you pay for, but frontier was upfront on their policies on their website. It got be from point A to B without any major issues. Good for solo traveler like myself. Also another tip, you have to pay for food and drinks from the beverage cart. It's not too expensive but just bring your own food onboard and fill up a water bottle at a water fountain in the airport. Just do some simple planning ahead and suck up the no frills experience. Literary all of these complaints on this website are because you have to bring a bag and pay for seats. Go fly a mainline carrier then, they're not much better.",Passive
"I cannot believe that BA calls their plane from Austin to London a ""Dreamliner"". I'm sitting in their so called ""club world"" which is the equivalent to Americans business class and this plane is awful! There is no room to put anything at all.

"  Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on.",Detractor
SIN-DOH-IKA on B787 and A320 return SYZ=DOH-SIN on A320 and A350. Seats very comfortable except for B787. I am only 5 foot 4 but the entertainment box which is under both the aisle and window seats is terribly intrusive. It was my first flight on a B787 and while the quiet engines and improved humidity were a welcome change the cramped seats made it very difficult to sleep. Will avoid flying with Qatar on the 787 in future. Thankfully they have decided to switch to the A350 to Singapore which was an infinitely more comfortable flight. Crew on all flights were excellent and food was generally very good. Fantastic personal AVOD available on every flight except from DOH-IKA.,Promoter

"  Helsinki to London Heathrow. This was a Finnair plus upgrade flight. It is 10000 points for an intra European upgrade, so not to difficult to achieve, you could buy 10000 points for 120 euros if you are a finnair plus member. Most passengers on the flight seemed to be transferring from flights from Asia. The lounge in Helsinki (non - schengen area) has a sauna and shower area. Bit odd as it is unisex but I had the whole place to myself (after 6pm it is quiet). Fairly good range of food, drinks etc in the nearly empty lounge. Of particular interest was the finnish bread. It took a while for the plane to load and get airborne but once we did the service was good. Newspapers offered. Two different types of champagne. Good meal, salmon, bread, veg, berry pie for desert. Flight attendants very friendly and attentive, more drinks freely available. V nice Ittala glasses and cutlery. I think the economy seats are a non issue on a short flight like this because the middle seat is kept free, therefore you can work etc in privacy and have a bit more legroom. I understand that this is the norm on European business class flights. I really enjoyed my experience flying Finnair business class which was significantly better than economy class or a low cost airline. In my own view, it makes flying something to look forward to. It is worth paying about 120 Euros, I would say. What would be nice by way of improvement is if drinks could be offered before take off and a choice of food. I think there is a way of ordering the meal online, but you are not prompted to when you check in online.",Promoter

They told her they could not find her reservation and even though she had a boarding pass they still denied her. When I called AA to talk to someone about this issue I was told ""its in our records she was late for the flight.""

BCN-MAD-BCN - I use the Barcelona-Madrid shuttle quite frequently and it is a great service. Check-in is fast in the Air shuttle terminal there is no security line and you can arrive at the airport just 20 minutes in advance. It is a short flight (55 minutes) that's why I prefer it over the high speed train (3 hours). The only thing I don't like is that they don't offer free drinks. It is a pity that they have cut down frequencies although there are still somewhere around 35 flights per day operated by Iberia. I would really recommend this service.,Promoter
" New York JFK to Milan via Copenhagen. We used Norwegian as our choice of airline. The airfare didn't seem so bad at first, $1,800.00 round trip. But then there is the cost of the luggage, since we had a layover in Denmark, we had to pay the luggage cost from NYC to Denmark, and then from Denmark to Italy. They charge not only for luggage but also for water, yes water, on a over 8 hour long trip they didn't have the courtesy to provide the customers with water. They also charge for blankets, food, snacks, everything. The sits in the airplane are very uncomfortable and they don't recline not even 1/2 inch. They crank up the AC in the airplane so if you don't have a sweatshirt you'd have to buy their blankets, otherwise you'd freeze. On our way back from Italy, we left from Malpensa airport. Our flight was supposed to leave at 13:50 on June 8th. The first bad sign about this whole experience with Norwegian was that there was not any Norwegian presence at the airport. We arrived the night before the flight at the airport and looked around and saw absolutely no Norwegian presence anywhere, not a sign or desk. I had to check by travel documents to make sure I was at the right airport. There was an airport strike and 99% of the flights were cancelled. But, of course our flight wasn't, in fact the flight left 2 hours earlier and my wife and I and quite a few other passengers weren't informed. No announcements, no emails, no texts. I called their customer service in the US and got a busy signal. I then called the Denmark customer service and because I was calling from Italy from my US phone, the signal was terrible and they couldn't understand me, at least that's what they told me, but I heard them loud and clear, they didn't want to bother with my problem. I called them a second time and the customer service heard me, but after a few seconds put me on hold and hung up. I called the US customer service and finally got a hold of someone, who did not care or helped me. She said I had to find someone in the airport to help me. After a while my nice manner with this customer service representative worn off and I gave her a piece of my mind about Norwegian airlines. Needless to say I got ripped off by an airline company that only care about taking advantage of customers with bait and switch tactics, terrible service, terrible customer service. In my mind for some reason I thought that European service/customer service would be a lot better then any other part of the world, but right now, its the worse possible. Norwegian did not refund my flight and I had to book a flight back from Malpensa to NYC and the only airline available that would fly that day was Emirates and for last minute booking for $1,200.00 for two people direct flight was fantastic. I think all airlines should look at how Emirates takes care of their customers and learn from them. They are an amazing airline.",Detractor

We booked a trip to Cancun on Sunwing. The flight down to Cancun was delayed almost an hour - nobody was informed until 30 minutes past our scheduled departure time. The inflight TVs didn't work at all the flight attendants made every request seem like the most difficult task and worst of all after travelling all night we arrived at the resort at 5am only to find that nobody had reservations at the resort until the following day. On return it was the same delay scenario. One hour late with no mention of it no apology nothing. Like it never happened. Also ensure your bags are underweight or you will get charged for as little as 0.5kg over weight. They weigh every article you have including my small inflatable pillow. I would never fly Sunwing again. In my opinion it is worth whatever it costs to maximize the precious minutes of your already short vacation. Sunwing wasted many minutes of our trip and caused more stress than they should. They do feed you for free and the food is actually not all that bad. Otherwise I have nothing good to say.,Detractor

My wife and I travelled 4 sectors in Cathay Business Class recently (CX110/CX261?CX260/CX139). We have a benchmark from travelling frequently with Qantas in Business. Several major aspects warrant comment. My wife is diabetic which was nominated at the time of booking. On one long overnight sector she asked for a light snack as she had to take medication. The staff member disregarded the request and offered no snack. However on the return long overnight sector a staff member when asked offered that a special snack had been loaded and was most obliging. What an inconsistency in the attitude of cabin staff. There appears to be no small snacks available at any time as is the case with competitors. Seat allocation. Was arranged at the time of booking which was some six months prior to departure. Boarding passes were issued at Sydney for the two sectors. Upon presentation at Hong Kong we were informed of a problem i.e the seat was broken and would not recline thus was unusable. We were asked to go to one side whereon we asked for a supervisor. Apparently our adjoining seats were not possible as one seat was broken (by coincidence the frequent flyer award seat). As the flight was almost fully booked we were allocated seats apart five and six rows behind. As it was nearly midnight we had little alternative. Upon boarding we overheard a passenger seating next to my wife who wished to be repositioned nearer his friend. We were able to sort this out and then inform cabin staff. Sometime later (there was an hour and a half delay before takeoff due to weather conditions) we noticed the original seat was occupied and was fully reclined. This seat was the frequent flyer seat.,Detractor

MEL-AKL-LAX return. Had been looking forward to trying ANZ PY and I was somewhat disappointed. The good things: Superb food better than C on QF oodles of room in the seats great cabin crew on all sectors priority boarding. However seats are uncomfortable. I appreciate the unique design but you just can't get into a good position. They are leather but in my opinion the padding is far too thin and the only way to sleep is to put the seat at full tilt pile up the bean bag with a cushion and lay out straight. Seeing the space the seats take up I'm not surprised ANZ are not going to continue them into new aircraft - they must lose money on them even at a premium fare. The design is also clunky in that nothing works smoothly - you need to force up the armrests and the seat belt is a pain. It has an airbag but it rests uncomfortably on your side. A great idea in theory - but not so good in practice.,Passive

" Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. I'm a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won't be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.",Passive

Checked baggage three pieces for two people were sent to Chicago instead of to Manchester UK resulting in three days of vacation without clothes. We had no carry on baggage. In SFO we booked baggage through Las Vegas on to Virgin Atlantic. Plane was clean and on time going and coming. Ticketing agent in Las Vegas on the 19th was rude and wrong.

" GA086 from Jakarta to London on June 28th with my daughter. Garuda arranged an early morning pick up to take us to the airport. Once we arrived at the airport we were met by the Garuda Ground Support Staff who helped us check-in, go through immigration and into the Lounge in a fast and efficient manner. The service in the Lounge was also very good as was the presentation of food and drinks available. When it came time to board the Garuda Ground Staff were on hand to escort me and my daughter to the aircraft. Once we were seated the on-board Garuda 5 Star service started and the cabin crew could not do enough to help myself and my daughter and this continued all the way into London. My daughter pre-ordered her meal on line and she really enjoyed the Steak Meal that she was served. On arrival in London we were met by the Garuda Group Support Team who helped and assisted us getting from Termianl-3 to Terminal-2 to check-in to our domestic flight. Again, I would like to highlight that the Garuda Ground support teams in Jakarta and London and the Cabin Crew staff are a credit to Garuda Indonesia as they really go out of their way to make you feel very special and appreciated.",Promoter

" Dublin to Newark. Nightmare flights to and from Ireland this Christmas. Being disabled with and severe limited mobility, bulkhead seats that I booked and selected online were denied on both flights. For the outbound, I was told there was a aircraft change and so the seats were to bumped to middle of row in front of the bulkhead, with no recline. I made sure to call Aer Lingus twice during my stay to ensure we had the correct seating for the return journey. Both times we were guaranteed that our seats were correct and it also reflected â€œextra legroomâ€ in the Aer Lingus App. On our return flight, I decided to check with the gate agent on our seating. He started off by stating that is illegal for someone like me to sit in those seats and said authorities may have to be called. I tried to correct him by say that these were bulkhead seats and not an exit row. He stated that disabled folks have no extra rights on a plane and that babies will always come first. I was stunned at this. Then comes the boarding and not once were people with mobility issues invited to preboard. So we were again seated in middle seating.",Detractor

Instead, we had to pay hundreds of dollars to get home from Chicago, and then Spirit only offered to refund us their supposed cost of the second leg of the flight, a quarter of what we paid.

I noticed also that they didn't serve drinks before landing at Bangkok whereas my Bangkok to Manila flight FA's served us drinks.

"  I've just travelled from LGW to BIO and back on Vueling. I'd read the mostly negative reviews before travelling and set off with a high degree of trepidation. However, the experience from end to end was excellent. Speedy check in at LGW and BIO. Very short delay (15 minutes) each end, but nothing to worry about. Very organised boarding at LGW - rear boards first, so bear that in mind when you are choosing seats, as there wasn't much overhead locker space for those who boarded last. Boarding at BIO was odd, as people formed a massive queue and stood in it for 45 minutes, only for the aircraft to be boarded by seat row number (rear first), so no queuing is necesssary. Aircraft both ways were modern A320s, very clean and smart inside. Not a lot of leg room, but, to be fair, what can you expect on a budget airline with a round trip price of Â£42. Service was polite and efficient. Cabin crew well presented. Most PAs were in Spanish, but, again it is a Spanish airline. (I've never heard EZY make PAs in Spanish either on their Spanish flights from the UK). So, all in all, a good experience.

"  Flew British Airways to/from Heathrow recently as first experience. Have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service. I absolutely agree, and what a shame. But BA, if you actually read some of these reviews, you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. When boarding, rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down, actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. Many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777's. Perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance? On long transatlantic flights, cabin stewards disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flight. Perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything? (Or are they fearful of the extra work?).",Detractor

The flight itself was just the same as any other airline no problem. But what really annoyed me was the treatment I received at check in. We flew from Blenheim to Auckland. A family group of 4 of us checked in. Maybe one case out of the 4 was overweight but they took into account that in total others were lighter and we did not exceed the overall allowance for 4 persons. All good so far. They insisted on weighing my hand luggage which had been stripped down to a few light items but the main content was my CPAP medical machine that deals with my sleep apnea condition a camera tablet and lap top. Overall weight was about 9kgs about 2kgs over the limit of 7kgs. The check in man told me that I was over the limit and would have to remove some items. I pointed out that I had a laptop hoping he would then just let it be. On the flight to Christchurch the Air New Zealand check in told me 9kgs including a laptop was OK and let the bag go. This time the man told me to remove the laptop so he could weigh the bag again. It is an ultra book so extremely light which still made my bag 8kgs. He still wasn't happy and insisted that I remove more items. This was extremely embarrassing for the sake of 1kg but in the end we placed some items in a plastic shopping bag which my wife was allowed to carry on because she only had a handbag. This reduced the weight down to 7kgs which made the check in man happy and I could then put my very light laptop back inside. Rules are rules fair enough but for goodness sake. My wife had next to no hand luggage why couldn't they just aggregate the weight for our group or at least for the 2 of us? In the end I put the items back in my bag anyway but the irony was that it was a small plane and the overhead lockers were too small to even take the regulation hand luggage bag I was using so it had to stay on the floor under the seat in front. So it wasn't as if the bag would have been too heavy for the overhead bin anyway. I expect this kind of treatment from a LCC but not from a full fare carrier like Air New Zealand. It was very embarrassed and it just left a bitter taste for the whole flight. I won't be rushing back to Air NZ I can assure you.,Detractor

Lacking food options, only a couple of stale sandwiches and plain rice. The flight from Manila to Beijing on B737-800 was comfy enough - never tried the food as catching up on sleep.

"My wife and I booked a flight on United Airlines from Seattle to San Antonio to attend our son's graduation from Air force Basic Military Training.

Flew from JFK to Rome. A330 in excellent condition. Seats were super comfortable with lie flat. 1-2-1 config is great. Entertainment system was excellent with large screen and excellent selection. Food was ample nicely presented. Excellent pasta. The cabin crew was very friendly and attentive. Overall impressed. Much better than my experience on Swiss or United or Lufthansa. On par with Delta's Business Elite.,Promoter
" Flew Avianca from Madrid to BogotÃ¡. At the check in I checked an additional bag without any problem to my existing bag, as I have only been on transit. I received a new boarding pass but Avianca failed to add the priority status which I had. At the gate however I checked and was able to do the priority boarding. The flight itself was ok, no major things that made me love or hate the airline during the flight. After arriving at the destination however Avianca failed to deliver my bags and after I received them approx 24 hours later Avianca refused to give me any kind of compensation for the items I had to get to cover for one day. So overall I would not suggest to take Avianca again.",Detractor
" Dhaka to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This trip was full of disappointments. Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest. We had a laugh- that was entertaining.- but not convincing for making Turkish Airline the choice any more.",Detractor
" Flew from Jakarta to London on GA 86 April 12, 2018. Garuda had arranged a car to pick up me. Upon arrival at Jakarta Terminal 3 the Garuda First-Class ground support team were waiting for me. They helped check me in and, then took me through immigration and straight into the lounge. There was a very good selection of food and drinks in the lounge. When time came to board the flight the ground support team were again on hand to escort me to the aircraft. The aircraft left the gate on schedule and we took off 20 minutes later due air traffic. The service on-board was the normal Garuda 5 Star service and the food prepared was excellent. There was free complimentary Wi-Fi onboard and the connection for the flight duration was excellent. We landed at Heathrow Terminal-3 one hour late due to strong head winds. I had a connecting flight from Heathrow Terminal-5 and I was afraid that I would miss my flight and have to spend one night at Heathrow. however the Captain had already contacted the Garuda team in Heathrow and they had arranged for one of their support team members at Heathrow Terminal-3 to escort me all the way through to my connecting flight gate in Heathrow Terminal-5. Furthermore they took my luggage from the plane and had directly taken to my connecting flight. This was Garuda Indonesia at its best i.e. Captain onboard calling ahead requesting the ground team to arrange assistance to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight. I must say a big thank you to the Garuda Captain and the Garuda Heathrow support team, they certainly pulled out all the stops to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight.

"  Our family flew Spirit round trip from Niagara Falls, NY to Orlando FL. Given the numerous concerns about this airline I had to make some comments. Being our first time using this airline, we had a very normal experience. As with any budget airlines you clearly know going in the cost and just need to be care and plan ahead. Even paying for our baggage both ways, as well as reserving seats so our family could sit together we saved hundreds of dollars. While our flight to Orlando was slightly delayed (we've been delay or had flights cancelled at the last minute with other more popular airlines - which seems to be the norm these days), our return flight home was on time. We received several emails regarding our flight status both ways. While you have to pay for baggage, including typical carry-ons that can be stored overhead, Spirit does allows one small carry on at no cost. Regular size backpacks were no problem. We found the flight attendants pleasant and attentive. They understand the seats are a bit narrow, especially for taller, long legged passengers. When they could, they encouraged people to move into areas of the plane that had more leg room. Given the high cost of air travel this summer, we would have no reservation taking Spirit again. It was well worth the cost.",Promoter

"  Xiamen to Beijing. My trip was meant to end in Europe via Beijing, however we were forced to land in an airport near Beijing due to severe thunderstorm in the Chinese capital. We were left speechless at the neighbouring airport without any ground staff changing tickets for me. We were then bused to a small hostel without any Air China members clarifying anything on our connection flight. When we then tried to call Air China customer hotline, we waited more than 20 mins on the line but no one picked up the phone. Shame on Air China for running such a shoddy service and you should blame your government for restricting air traffic so much in the last few months. None of the flights departed from China was on schedule. Shame on you for making such an international farce.",Detractor
" Houston to Los Angeles. We boarded at 7:30 pm everything seem to be ok and we were on the run off ready to take off when he captain announced the plane has to returned to the gate due some mechanical problem, we were repeatedly asked to stay on the plane. After almost 4+ (11:30 pm) hours we were told the plane was fixed and that we would be taking off. 30 minutes later we were told they didn't have any flight attendants because they have to check out due â€œlong hoursâ€ and if we waited a few minutes the replacement flight attendants were in the airport and on their way. After another hour of waiting we were told they couldn't get flight attendants and deboarded the plane. I was in lne trying to get in to the earliest flight posible and ask for arrangements to sleep since it was almost 1:40am airline personel where rude, refuse to make areangements to reroute baggage to my flight because there was nobody to do it at that time... they also told me as a local i was not entitle to accomodations they asked me to go home and return at 4am to board my new flight for the rest they keep telling people not to stand in line. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. they had plenty time to Make arrangements to help passanger they left stranded althdought they wait until last minute when everybody in the airport was gone, i even findout the flight was delayed until next morning by checking online before they announced it. Customer service is unexistant... even over the phone people lied to me with different stories and promises they knew they were lies, my luggage arrived late at my destination dispite several employees assuring me it was going to be on my new flight... on top of experience rude employee in IAH the phone personel are useless and several hung up on me.. nobody care how much they abuse passangers. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly.

AGP to BKK via ZRH. All flights ran slightly early. I find Swiss to be consistently good but not fabulous. Prices in Business out of Spain always one of the best and makes the 7 hour layover in ZRH justifiable. Fully flat seat a little hard even after choosing soft function.

"Dublin to Montreal via Toronto with Air Canada rouge. Having read the many negative reviews of Air Canada rouge, we were not looking forward to the experience. Had checked in online, but on arrival at the bag drop, a combination of a systems glitch and an inexperienced check in girl, insisted that we had checked in a bicycle - we stood at the head of an restless crowd for at least 20 minutes, until the mythical bike was dispatched to cyber space and our boarding cards were handed over. It was onwards and upwards from there. Our full flight with a high baby count left on time and was reasonably peaceful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast. Our seats in front of (and seemed attached to) the toilets meant we heard and felt every flush but mercifully nothing more. While we found the young Air Canada rouge staff to be professional, they lacked charm and seemed incapable of smiling. Fastest deplaning ever in Toronto, as connecting passengers we were fast tracked through immigration and customs and so had time for a nice lunch prior to our on time departure to Montreal. This short flight was operated by Air Canada, and what a difference - charm, courtesy and even a drink and snack. Our trip home was a doddle, effortless check in at Montreal, very pleasant flight with Air Canada, easy on time connection to Air Canada rouge in Toronto. A full but quiet flight home to Dublin marred only by a truly vile diner (and a charge of 6 dollars for a small bottle of wine). Air Canada rouge personnel glum and would certainly benefit from instruction from Air Canada personnel. Overall and for the price paid, we certainly got value for money. Would probably prefer to travel with the full fare Air Canada in future. ***NO NAME",Promoter

I flew with my wife from Thessaloniki to Rome and back. Both flights were delayed. Plane could be cleaner. As it is an international flight almost 2 hours the only thing you get is a drink and a small bag of biscuits. The coffee is awful. The staff could be more polite. The worst impression was on the return flight. We had only one suitcase which weighed 25 kg. Staff told us that we had to take 2 kg out because only 23kg was allowed. When we told her that we were 2 people but had only one suitcase much less than allowed (23x2 = 46kg) she insisted that we should take 2 kg out of the suitcase. So we had to open our suitcase at the airport. We will never choose this airline again.,Detractor
Flew from Seattle on December 3rd. Arriving to Chicago we have found that our flight AA4250 to Hartford has been canceled. The AA representative has claimed that it is because of weather which was impossible to believe as practically all the flights to New England had been on time. We realized lately that they canceled it due to small amount of passengers.

"  Flew Paris CDG to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. First long haul flight in a very long time on an Thai A380. Royal Silk Class is a 1-2-1 configuration, and I had a B seat (window side, but slightly separated from the wall). Comfortable seat, two window-side storage bins, plenty of space between the seat and the window to put your shoes and other stuff. What I like of the A380 seat is that you can slide the tray with your full dinner on it and easily move out of your seat. I am used to high quality service and excellent food in Royal Silk, but this time the service highly exceeded any previous experience. Excellent flight overall. If I only had any - very minor - complaints it would be that, after 5 years in service, the monitors seem to have a lower resolution than more modern aircraft (or probably it's only my impression, as my inbound flight was on a super modern A350 where the monitor quality was impeccable), also, the restrooms, even in Royal Silk, feel quite small comparing to Thai's A350 or B747. Also about the restrooms, I was happy to find that the moisture lotion has gone back to the excellent Bulgari Eau ParfumÃ©e au ThÃ© (Blanc now, it used to be Vert a few years ago), after switching to Era's Cloud Nine for a while. The only pity is that the lady in front of me stole the whole bottle after less than 15 minutes into the flight. Despite these little details, a great flight experience! One final note: check-in, as always at CDG, was a nightmare. But it wouldn't be fair to give a bad evaluation to Thai's ground staff for that, as it was handled by CDG's staff. Even at embarkment, the lines handled by Thai's staff proceeded very swiftly, while my line (handled by CDG staff) was incredibly slow.",Promoter

The food is close to vile and prices are ridiculous - 14 euros! Captain did not say anything during our flight. Most seats were broken and arm rests taped! 1st flight our plane still smelt of cigarette - looked like a plane from the 80s. Funny thing tickets were not that cheap either!

"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul Ataturk to Cairo on a midnight flight. Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.",Passive

"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent.

Dinner was edible but breakfast was better. Drinks are free flow and crew are happy to serve water. IFE is channel-based (you don't get to choose the show on demand, rather what is being shown), and it may not interest those who don't know Chinese well. Did not hear the Captain speak for this long stretch, and crew's English announcements can be hard to hear. Flights to and from TPE: Breakfast appeared to be simpler. Captain did give announcement for this stretch. Wifi IFE is available for flights to and from TPE, but Air China specifically bars mobile phones from accessing this system. If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE). ATC delayed 1.5 hours both directions. Overall a decent value for money, if you have China on your visit list and don't really mind about the IFE.

NZ80 HKG to AKL. 22nd June 2014. Business Class. B777-200ER. The aircraft was old and shabby. The herringbone seat configuration facing away from the window is like a coffin. The seat is narrow and has limited recline when seated normally as the lay flat bed requires the seat back to be folded fully forward. The bed is reasonably comfortable with the mattress pad. The welcome aboard drink was Sparking Wine not Champagne and served by one of the 3 Grumpy Old Men who were attending the forward cabin. Food was just edible and the choices very poor. No wines listed and when asked was told Pinot Noir or Cab Sav. No hangars suitable to hang trousers for those who change into travelling clothes. The AV is something out of the ark. A screen that has a resolution such that everything looks as if the lens is smeared with Vaseline. A controller whereby when pressed takes a few seconds to respond and sound and screen hesitation on both movie and audio channels (seat 3A if anyone from AirNZ read these posts). Breakfast coffee was vile but the hot bacon roll was a pleasant change. I hope the B777-300 is a step up as I have a west coast return trip soon. If not I shall stick to SQ and EK for all my long haul trips. There are better alternatives and the penny pinching shows maybe this route doesn't justify anything better but even CX with the dated A340 aircraft on this route is a much better experience.,Detractor

The food service was plentiful but not very nice (pasta was hard and chewy) and drinks were left at the back of the plane so passengers could help themselves during the flight. Just make sure you don't sit in a window seat or either of the middle seats in the middle block, as the entertainment systems are stored at your feet which severely impacts your legroom.

I asked for tea twice and no one ever brought any, I tried to call the flight attendant with the call button several times, but I guess they disconnected this function because it bothers them. The only reason I believe Air Canada rouge still exists is because they have no competition and they force you to take it as there is no other options to fly where you want to go.

Thanks to being in the aisle seat, I could stretch out my right leg at times. Boarding at both airports were smoothly organized by boarding groups and overhead luggage space was ample. Individual flight entertainment systems were easy to use and they had a good collection of Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movies. Beer and wine were complimentary. Two meals were served, portions were small. Lot of special meals -- kosher, Asian vegetarian, etc -- were delivered by frazzled flight attendants running up and down to match meals with passengers.

Onboard entertainment is below the level acceptable for long flights. Sandwich that we got for breakfast must have been a few days old. In front of us was a family with 3 kids and the father reclined the seats back during take off. He was not willing to set them into the upright position even during dinner. The cabin staff did not want to react - they said that nothing could be done. Will avoid Austrian flights in the future.,Detractor
"Very disappointed and particularly unimpressed by crew on board. Gave an attitude of not caring about passengers, unfriendly and unprofessional. On outgoing journey no apologies for late arrival or information/reassurance about what I perceived to be a difficult landing. On return journey captain could not be heard due to faulty system, steward laughed during safety announcement and did not finish. Food service was poor missing rows of people and giving attitude of 'I just want to finish my shift'. It certainly lives up to its reputation of a cheap airline.",Detractor
" Tel Aviv to Munich. Lufthansa has to think about their boarding procedures in Tel Aviv. We waited 25 minutes for boarding and it took us a long time to get all passengers inside the A321, so we left Tel Aviv with about 30 minutes delay. The cabin staff were kind of stressed and unfriendly, due to a group of passengers who stood in the aisle all the time during the flight. Once they announced there will be a delay at the arrival and they will give further information about connecting flights. The passenger next to me asked how long the delay will probably be but the stewardess did not know. They also announced a gate as arrival position in MUC which doesn't exist. The seats were good, with enough space even for tall passengers, but only two lavatories for 180 economy passengers? There was no inflight entertainment. Really poor for a four hour flight. The meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to TLV. Lufthansa makes many promises with their advertisement of being a five star airline butare not able to keep many of them on longer flights with the A321. I will think about an alternate low-cost flight next time.",Passive

EY 641 8 July 2014 AUH-NBO. EY 642 12 July 2014 NBO-AUH. We expected much more. Both our flights we had inattentive crew malfunctioning and/or broken seat equipment and IFE weird menu options. When trying to view 'our Network' the IFE the screen simply went blank and showed a white fuzzy box. Looking in the magazine or asking crew members did not make matters better. Offering bags of plastic packaged caramel corn before landing also seemed a bit off for an award winning airline. Both of our flights departed and arrived very very late as well. The only positive for them is the quality of economy class headsets and honestly outside of that the experience on their competition especially Emirates is far superior!,Detractor

After a lot of hesitation I booked finally a ticket in business class for the above said trip. The flight BRU-CAI was a smaller jet so you cannot expect too much. Food and service were acceptable. The 2nd sector went from CAI to BKK (night flight). Food service and attitude from the staff was similar to other carriers while the flight entertainment was good but not super. The seats can ""almost"" be considered as a flat bed so a good rest is almost guaranteed. The lounges in CAI are very average where no alcohol will be served (neither during the flights) however if you buy your beer or wine in the food court you can drink it in the lounge.

"  I had a flight leaving out of Washington DC to go to Arizona (layover) then to California. My flight leaving from DC was at 7:01, we board the plane and then after an hour of sitting, the plane tells us to get off due to technical issues. I believe it was either smoking and there was an issue with the hydraulic system. So our flight departure time got pushed back to 9, then to 10, then. 12. And at 12 they said they would let us know if we could board the plane. 12 o'clock came, they said no, then pushed departure back to 2. Once two o'clock came, we no longer had a pilot or a flight crew. So we now have to wait for a flight crew. Pushed out time back to 3:30 then to 3:55. FINALLY we board and take off to Pheonix, AZ. I had to reschedule my layover flight now to arrive in California at 10pm, when originally I should've been to California by 12pm. My layover flight at AZ departure time is 8:37pm. We board the plane, and then get a text message (with their updates) that the flight gate has changed. They make an announcement after finish letting us board to say the plane is out of service we will be going to another plane. Now push back time is 9:00pm.

"My partner and I were on flight TK53 from Tokyo to Istanbul and were due to get a connecting flight home to Dublin (TK1975). Approximately 2 hours before we landed, we saw live TV coverage of the Coup from Istanbul and waited for updates from cabin crew. An hour later, the pilot announced that we would not be landing in Istanbul due to ""operational reasons"". This was the one and only announcement given until 12 hours later. We landed in Antalya and were brought into a working terminal. We sat and waited patiently. At 6am, we were bussed to another terminal - an unused, abandoned terminal with no facilities or options to get food and very little air con on what was an extremely warm morning. There were no reps from Turkish Airlines, there was no WIFI, there was no communication of any sort. At midday, a cafe was opened and food served at high prices. The free food of water and bread became tiresome as that was our only option since landing at 4am. At 8pm we were informed our flight would be returning to Istanbul and there we would be met by reps who would transfer our boarding passes. We were assured all would run smoothly and we would have the option of getting a hotel for the night. Upon arrival at Istanbul, we joined the queue for the transfer desk. It took 6.5 hours to reach the top of the queue - no reps, nobody to answer questions, no customer service whatsoever. When we finally got to the desk, we were met by staff members who were more interested in updating their Facebook Status' rather than helping the customers standing in front of them.

" Milan Malpensa to Barcelona and we missed our connected flight Barcelona to Palma. Terrible experience with Vueling. Me, my husband and other passengers not related to us â€“ were refused boarding. We were refused to board the plane, even though we've checked in online 1 day before, and passed passport control and were waiting at the gates in the queue. And all of us were blamed by the airline that it was our fault and we have been waiting at the wrong gate. The truth is that Vueling at the last moment before boarding changed the gates which was originally on the screens and didn't announce the change. Instead they announced gate 7 to Barcelona, which we went to (apparently it was added second plane/flight by them). There were two identical flights by Vueling from Milan to Barcelona at the same time from the same terminal of Malpensa. As we discovered later â€“ from the gate #7 and gate #1 (after gates changes were amended). We came to the gate 7, Which was announced and we gave our boarding passes and passports to the lady who checked them at the boarding desk â€“ she said â€œwait in the queueâ€ , she didn't even mention anything that we are at the wrong gate and wrong flight. Vueling sold way more tickets than they could board and that's why had to create this mess and to confuse passengers to make sure to get rid of us, as there were no more seats on the plane as we understood. They didn't announce a last call either â€“ to invite right passengers to the right gate â€“ because they were interested to get rid of us, not board us. The airline then delayed the flight (from gate 1) for 1.5 hour, because they needed time to find our suitcases to kick them off the plane, but they didn't have seats to board us which would be faster. We've spent all night searching for the new tickets and had to travel from Malpensa to Linate airport to catch the new flight we booked, which cost us 409.70 EUR plus 25EUR luggage, plus bus + taxi fees. We also lost lots of nerves and one day of our 4 days holidays at Mallorca and we are very disappointed with this fact and will demand compensation from Vueling for us.

I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again.

I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.,Detractor

"Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline?

Food, I ordered special meals which came as requested and okay. In Dubai had to be transferred to and from the planes by bus which lengthens the transfer time. The airport has been built to take more people but seems to be bursting at the seams.

IFE was AVOD movie selection was fine but has room for improvement. FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended.

FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped.

All the hotels were booked in a 20 mile radius, so we took a lift back to my apartment in Philadelphia, which cost $150. I called the next morning and was assured I would get that money back. I submitted a form, and an agent online assured me that all I had to do was submit another form. I tried to submit that form, couldn't because I didn't have a valid ticket because I had gotten a refund, and called again a month ago - when I was again assured I would get reimbursed. It's been a month and I have heard nothing from them. If you like wasting money, having people tell you nice things with no follow through, and getting stranded in New Jersey, United is your airline.

AC 1880 and 1881 return from Toronto to Sarasota this past winter. We had the bad luck of being on a Rouge flight. I have one word to describe the experience. Awful. This old refurbished equipment which seems to have a lot of mechanical problems. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. There is minimal leg room even if you pay extra for the seats with supposed extra space. AC advertises this Rouge flight as a more economical flight. The only thing economical about it is the interior. We paid exactly the same as we have paid in all the other years we have gone to Sarasota. Business Class is a total joke. On our trip back to Toronto we only found out that the flight was delayed when we got to the airport. Flight Tracker gave no indication of this delay neither did the AC website. It would have been nice to have been notified of this delay by phone email or text thus saving us having to spend an excruciating amount of time at the Sarasota airport. Having tracked the arrival and departure times of these flights over the past several weeks of this winter it seems that the norm has been at least a 1 hour delay. The weather was not always a factor. AC has to improve this. We have choices as to how we get to Sarasota. It is for certain that we will not ever fly on a Rouge flight again.,Detractor

That was the only good thing about the flight, as this was an Air Canada Rouge flight. When we were boarding, I thought that the stewards were in fancy dress. They were casually dressed, as was their manner. As our flight was due to leave and did at 10.30 p.m., I did not expect food, but at 11.45 p.m. we were presented with the most awful slop. I was woken up, leave me alone. This was the start of a little girl screaming for hour after hour. I expected that we would get a light breakfast, but we got a slice of cake and a drink and this was for a flight that landed at 10.45 am. There was no entertainment, but they were hiring out ipads at 10$ a time. Obviously this is the bargain basement arm of Air Canada, even if it is not reflected in the price.",Detractor
Our trip from Singapore to Brisbane was very unpleasant. During our holiday we also flew with Emirates Cathay and Dragonair and all 3 were vastly better airlines to fly with. The seats on the 747 are the narrowest I have encountered and the armrests which could not be tucked away were an inconvenience a waste of space and made the seats all the more uncomfortable. The meals were pathetic and the flight attendants took forever to serve the meals. Furthermore our meal choice ran out quickly and the only available meal fish in kung pao sauce was spicy. The lack of a hot breakfast on the 7 hour flight was also disappointing and the breakfast of yoghurt and cinnamon scroll left us very hungry. The overall flight experience was awful. Qantas is simply incompetent and no competition for professional airlines like Emirates and Cathay. Will avoid Qantas at all costs.,Detractor
First time flying to Bangkok from Heathrow with Eva Air (usually go Thai but Eva was cheaper). The planes looked pretty new legroom OK in Economy and I thought the food no better or worse than other economy class offering. The seat-back screens were clear to see but the entertainment options were pretty poor. Eva make a big deal about their memory foam seats but these are the hardest seats I've ever had and made for a really uncomfortable journey! Also if you wait for the cabin crew to bring around drinks you'll be seriously dehydrated. I made sure I bought some water with me on the return journey.,Promoter
BHX to CMB and back. The first flight to CMB was awful we had to wait 2 hours more then expected I had a baby and my son with me and they did not offer my children any meals or food for the whole flight. My son was upset because he did not receive the small backpack with colouring pencils and a colouring book (which you normally get for kids). The return flight however was pleasant we did get food this time and the crew was friendly! We paid enough money for the ticket so I hope next time will be a lot better on both flights.,Passive

Used the more economical option from Malpensa do Faro at the same day but caused high extra costs. It's a real shame for the lack of professionalism and ethic, will try to avoid this airline.",Passive

We flew a family of 6 CGK-TLV and TLV-AMS all via IST. First time flying and we were satisfied. Plane departed late from Jakarta but made up in the air and arrived in Istanbul 5min behind schedule and we were on time for our connecting flight to Tel Aviv. It was on a A330 seats felt wider than any other airlines IFE was good food definitely better than average airline food and service from the cabin crew was friendly. The plane made a stop in Singapore. IST-TLV-IST on a smaller 319 without IFE service is ok. IST-AMS on a old very small B737 here the seats felt cramped. Overall TK is a good airline for the price we paid we will definitely use them again.,Passive
"  Faultless travel on a trip from Copenhagen to Buenos Aires via Istanbul and Sao Paulo. A321 and Boeing 777-300 aircraft, flights on time. First flight full, the following only 50% loaded as it is a new route to TK. Check in smooth, though staff had limited experience and understanding. However, lounge access and seat wishes accommodated. Service onboard was top notch. However, despite being kind and service minded, the FAs had very limited English skills and were all of the same, Turkish nationality. Even on the Europe leg, two hot meals of decent quality was offered in economy. Plus free drinks - 3 drink rounds were accomplished. STPC stopover provided in IST, despite the ticket was extremely cheap and said the opposite. IST airport is a hassle with long queues and repetitive security checks. IFE works fine, even on the smaller A321 aircraft. The longhaul leg on Boeing 777-300 was my longest flight ever. Newer aircraft, equipment, and excellent staff. Hot meals served three times. Plenty of drink rounds. Good beers, particularly I liked Tuborg Gold beer on cans. Wines mediocre, both were Turkish. Staff language skills extremely limited, apart from Turkish and Spanish - on the last leg from Sao Paulo to BUE. Amenity kit set with 6 items given. Poor headsets, good IFE. I had no inscribed luggage nor no change/delays issues which make me score TK high, as everybody knows that the problems always come with any irregularity or luggage.",Promoter

The restrooms were at the end and they were very busy. Ottawa-Frankfurt: The Service was very poor. We had a Seat in the last row and we got only veggie meals. Unfortunately they had no more meat meals for us. The beverages were poor too. No more Coke Zero after 1/3 off flight time. They had enough Alcohol on Board.,Detractor
"  Doha to London Heathrow. Having flown into Doha with Qatar Airways, the flight with British Airways was a shock. For a start the Club world seats are not comfortable. There is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces. The cabin crew were indifferent. We departed at approximately 9am. Immediately on reaching cruising altitude, we were informed that they were now serving ""lunch"". At 10am. We were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent, this on a 7 hour flight. A cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. I don't know what timezone ""lunch"" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class. I was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight. I did complain immediately to BA and to their credit, I received a response - basically they were sorry I felt this way. Never again. Pay a fortune for this basic service.",Detractor

" Overall, amazing experience in premium economy on the flight Moscow to New York. Started with a hassle-free boarding. During the flight, impeccable service was provided by attentive flight crew. Comfortable seats with very decent leg room and foot support. The food quality and choice can rival business class on some airlines - three choices of main course (which was served on china and with metal cutlery) were offered at both meal services. Healthy snack variety and ice-cream were provided in between. Rich entertainment program. Clean cabin and lavatories. Best value for money. Would definitely fly with them again.",Promoter
"This was my first time booking a flight for my son with Spirit Airlines flying from Aguadilla P.R to Baltimore MD. When my son was checking in the baggage, which I had already prepaid for online, he had to pay an additional $25.00 again due to it being overweight. I was very disappointed. No savings here since only one baggage came up to $50.00, a convenience that nearly no major airlines charge for. Looks like I paid over $160.00 for what originally looked like $106 one way trip flight. In addition the flight from Aguadilla P.R to Fort Lauderdale (FL) was delayed an hour, this cause meant that my son missed the flight from Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore MD (BWI) that was supposed to arrive at Baltimore at 9.32 am. With this miss he had to stay at Fort Lauderdale airport for approx. 8 hours since the next flight for Baltimore was at 3.00 pm with an arrival time of 5.32 pm. This is unacceptable since they booked a flight with a 1-2 hour connection.",Detractor
"  Having used Eurowings / Germanwings / Lufthansa for the past few years flying frequently throughout each year between Hamburg and Birmingham I have become very disappointed with their service of late with regard to frequent flight schedule changes. These have occurred whether or not bookings have been made well in advance or at short notice. Despite accepting my bookings and payments for direct flights, they have changed my last few flight schedules multiple times to completely unsuitable indirect flights. These flights would have extended my journey time (which is usually one hour 20 mins flight) by between three and seven hours, if not more, due to the bad connections. I have had to repeatedly rearrange my plans and re-book flight dates and times which has sometimes resulted in me missing appointments / events. If the airline(s) wish to discontinue their direct flights between Birmingham / Hamburg they should not make them available to book and then withdraw them sometimes almost immediately after booking is confirmed. This has made me very reluctant to book further flights with Eurowings. I have emailed customer service about this several times over the past few months and am yet to receive a reply, just automatic acknowledgements. Only after my first email was submitted I was advised I would receive a reply within 6 weeks, which I find unacceptable. I have since found another airline that have re-introduced this route so my next flight on this route is already booked with them. Apart from this the I have found Eurowings flights are generally on time, check-in staff and on board service satisfactorary. Overall their flight schedules need to be more reliable and online customer service needs serious attention.",Detractor
"  Return London Heathrow to Perth via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Generally I was quite satisfied with all four legs of this journey. Grumbles are:- I booked the ticket six months in advance but one month later asked about paying for an upgrade to Business Class for the 23.55 flight out of Perth but was quoted an extra Â£2000 just for this. (Did not buy) I was at back of cabin by the bulkhead, seat 32A, Perth to HK. Continuous cool draft from three sides for whole flight meant this I was too cold to sleep even with 2 blankets and a newspaper under my shirt. Most people in PE appeared cold. My advice is to take a fleece in your carry-on. CP had several staff at Perth at the departure gate who have English as their first language. Why were the announcements done by someone who does not, who spoke extremely rapidly and was completely unintelligible? Food was generally OK, but coffee was in very short supply and no refills were offered.",Promoter

"  Orlando to Cleveland. My family was in Orlando during the hurricane warnings. We had originally had airlines to leave on Saturday the 9th. Frontier sent us an email offering a flight out on 9/7 at 7am. We went ahead and booked that as well. They offered these flights at $29 dollars. Very affordable and not gouging like other airlines at this time. Words cannot convey how blessed we are to have received this offer from Frontier. We called in and not only did they change our flight but credited back money from the flight on Saturday. They got us out and also took people on stand by. They waited to get as many people out as possible. The pilot, and flight attendants were all helpful and caring. The pilot said the crew was out of Maui and what an amazing crew!! We have flown with Frontier several times before and have never had any issues at those times . Only good things to say about them. Thank you Frontier for what you offered and got us out of Orlando in time. If we wouldn't have had the other offer Frontier gave to us and changed ticket dates we would of been stuck as they are closing the airport. We give Frontier a thumbs up and will use them often for other travel destinations. Thank you Frontier for helping us and making a way out.",Promoter
"Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai on Emirates. Check in and boarding at Gatwick smooth and departed on time. My pre booked seat was changed to accommodate a family but my reassigned seat was still an aisle which was my preference. The drink trolley took a long time to come around and was followed by the food trolley. Meal was braised beef which was OK, but only lukewarm. The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel. All in all, an okay experience but the crew need to sort out the trolley service a bit.",Promoter
  Flights to and from Edinburgh to Geneva were late by over 1 and 1.5h respectively.

"  Flight OS81 from Vienna to Los Angeles. I had flown Austrian only once before, and it was a relatively good experience, so I was expecting a lot out of Austrian. Fortunately, I was very impressed. Check-in was relatively slow, but the lady there gave us a warm greeting and sent our checked bags away quickly. The flight was fully booked, so there were plenty of people in line. The gate felt extremely small, especially on a fully booked flight. Austrian fortunately was good at crowd control, so people got to their respective seats quickly. The seat was clean and very comfortable, and had all the basic functions and necessities you would expect. Pillows and blankets were provided on this 11 hour and 40 minute flight, even though it was a day flight. The flight attendants, as always, were extremely kind and compassionate and always there when you needed them. Soon after takeoff, lunch was served. It was a mushroom pasta dish, which was pretty tasty. The IFE worked pretty well and was responsive, although it didn't have many movies or TV shows, unlike Lufthansa. Where Austrian makes up for this is in their prestigious service and delicious food. Snacks and drinks were served consistently throughout the flight. Near the end of our flight, a small meal of more pasta with olives and zucchini was served with some sort of pudding. It was phenomenal. We parked at one of LAX's satellite terminals, and had to get bused over to Terminal 6 for Customs, which I find a bit inefficient. Overall, it was a fantastic flight. I would definitely recommend Austrian Airlines to anyone.",Promoter

" Charlotte to Las Vegas. The flight was late to leave, but today that is normal place. We take off for a cross country flight. The sole flight attendant in first class, seems to not have her wits with her today, but she remains pleasant. They serve drinks and offer a complimentary snack, your choice of two pieces of cheese and some grapes or three edamame pods floating on a wasabi colored mush of humus. I think sometimes their chef just feels like they have to be creative, and i am sure they won some fabulous airlines chef award for creativity. Comfort food, may not win the award but I bet customers would be happier. Then we went to use the AA entertainment system, however it appeared to not be operating. The partner of our witless attendant when asked if it was working barked a quick NO and kept walking. Not worth flying American. I wonder if AA Senior management ever flies their airlines to check on service",Detractor

The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland.

"I flew from Winnipeg to Cancun with Rouge in August. My husband and I took 23 guests on our wedding vacation. From the get-go our entire wedding party had an awful experience. The flight from Toronto: in the beginning we were frustrated that we didn't get certain things that were promised to us when we booked our wedding through Air Canada Vacations. We were supposed to receive a complimentary upgrade which we did not (to make matters more frustrating there was another wedding party on the same flight of which the bride and groom were upgraded). They were also supposed to hang my dress on the plane and when my mom asked they said there was no room. While this on its own was frustrating the flight was delayed by about an hour. We were told to stay in our seats with our seatbelts fastened this entire time. We were travelling with our 9 month old daughter. When I got up to get her formula out of the overhead bin about halfway through this wait I was rudely scolded by the flight attendant and told to sit down. She slammed the bin shut. Everything else about the experience is just how most people say - seats are jam packed with virtually no leg room there is absolutely no in-flight entertainment and they only offer juice water and pop (everything else you need to pay for). If I thought the flight there was bad I don't even know what to call the flight home. After boarding the plane in Cancun we sat on the tarmac for three hours while they tried to sort out mechanical issues. Again travelling with a baby this was a complete nightmare. During the entire wait we were offered water twice. Eventually they told us we would be staying in Cancun. We disembarked and they put us in a small holding area with no air conditioning. We waited here for another three hours without being offered any food or drink. When passengers started to get testy they walked us through the airport to immigration. We waited and waited while all 200+ passengers went back through immigration and security. When we finally got outside and hopped on shuttles the Air Canada Rep said ""the hotel is all-inclusive - go eat drink."" When we got to the hotel they told us that Air Canada had not in fact paid for all-inclusive. We were only entitled to a meal and two non-alcoholic beverages. While this wasn't a huge deal it just demonstrates the disorganization and lies that were the theme of our entire day. I will never travel with Air Canada Rouge again. The next morning at the airport only some of our wedding guests were given connecting flights through to Winnipeg. Once we arrived in Toronto we were sent home on three separate flights. On our flight there were six guests. Three were offered a complimentary food item ""for their trouble"". Apparently the rest of us (including the bride and groom) were not on the ""list"". All in all Air Canada Rouge turned our wedding vacation into a complete nightmare.",Detractor

Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy.

I found seats perfectly fine for both the outward leg and the return one too. The food was tasty and had 3 choices and it came quickly, nice wine but not much choice in spirits (gin please!). The crew were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I was even offered an extra meal as I was complimentary about my meal from Bahrain to Bangkok! The movie selection was ok but nothing too special, and you had to watch a 2.5 minute Bahrain airshow footage each time you wanted to watch something, which was a bit irritating, but nothing too bad. The moving map was informative and information on local times and eta were handy as well. The plane was clean, blankets offered and the toilets were clean on all of the flights. I couldn't really fault anything major at all. I would recommend them to anyone wanting a good priced scheduled airline that didn't mind a change in Bahrain for longer haul flights.",Promoter

"  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Jakarta. Overall a very good business class experience. Pros: Seat comfort on A330 and 777 good. Very comfortable lie flat in 777 and had good nights sleep. Service - excellent, friendly and obliging, Food - absolutely delicious. Some of the best food I have ever had in the air (definitely stick with the asian dishes, the western ones were less successful). Wine and drinks great as well. Terrific champagne which always makes me happy. Price - cheapest business class to Europe at the time of booking. On time - no delays. Cons: Jakarta stop over - it's long and the airport is dismal, likewise the lounge. I dont know if there's a refurb happening in the future but it needs it. IFE - not great selection. I had exhausted all options by the time we got to Jakarta. Ensured I slept more on flight through to AMS. In summary, given the price paid it was a very pleasant journey. They lack the polish of some of the big guns, but you would be hard pressed to find a better experience at this price.",Promoter
"London to Brisbane via Hong Kong, and a last minute purchase at xmas meant the most expensive airline ticket I'd paid for. Cathay Pacific was still cheaper than the others. Flights selected gave me a journey time of 26hrs out and 24hrs back which was pretty good. Seats are wide and I was very grateful as I was stuck next to person of size on the first leg to HKG. Why do they let people this size into an economy seat I don't know. I stood for 3 hours of the 12 hour leg. All other sectors were fine and very comfortable for an economy product. Tasty food was served, a little odd with the timings I thought. Crew were hard working. There was an issue with the first 777's water supply and we were told not to use the water in the loos, but the hand wipes provided. Good quality screens, albeit a little slow to react to screen presses. Decent 6"" recline on seat and I felt very comfortable.

Next they have to figure out if they can get him onto the plane on a ticket he already has so he and the two babies rush to the boarding dock while my wife and I wait to make sure we don't have to take him back home with us.

With the exception of the size of the lavatory and the ground crew in Auckland during transit, I could not nitpick anything. I was pleasantly surprised how great the seats were for length. The lavatory lacked space and was just as cramped as any economy toilet and one member of ground staff decided to get on the phone about one thing while I was boarding holding me up. The manager did come over and tell her to hurry up as it's delaying boarding, but it was frustrating having to wait for what sounded a pointless call. But besides those two things.

Cathay Premium Economy is about extra space and absolutely nothing else. If all you are seeking is additional space then fine but this is not true Premium Economy.

" Paris to Dubai via Kiev. An airline with very poor business practices. On the return flight at check in, was all the sudden asked to paid for my luggage. Was free on the way to Dubai! I have tried to get an explanation from the airline representative and try to show him the online terms and conditions mentioned on UIA site, but he only gave me an angry look and suggest me to call the hotline in Kiev (at 3am in the morning from a mobile phone in Dubai, imagine the cost of it and how helpful this is). To make the situation harder, you cannot pay with a credit card, you are sent to a cashier which is at the other end of the terminal and after 20 mn waiting you discover that this is cash only and nothing else. If you have no way to get cash, do not try to negotiate with the company representative, he will just ignore you. The whole process took me 2h 30min. I bought the ticket on UAI site, why was I not able to pay for the luggage fees with the same tool? Also at the departure the flight was on time at 11am, then one hour late at 12 and all the sudden going back to on time status, 20 min prior boarding, so everyone was rushing to get there in time. The planes were good but sometimes late. The flight attendants not always smiling, but most of the 4 flights were late.",Detractor

"  Brussels to Singapore via Doha. Efficient check in at Bru airport, no priority security clearance for Qatar passengers. Qatar uses the BA lounge, which is rather basic. Boarding fast and organized. Seat on both flights identical, the great herringbone seats. Very comfy with lots of storage space. Service impeccable, food ex Brussels very average, slightly better ex Doha. Doha lounge massive, with good drinks, but average food. The place lacks soul. I had the chance to compare the B787 and A350 here, and the 350 wins with flying colors. Much quieter than the Boeing 787, the air is significantly less dry, the window shields more sophisticated, and even the toilet flush worked better. It feels more spacious and elegant than the 787. Overall good flights with average food.",Promoter

"  Took a domestic flight from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agent. Check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. My baggage didn't arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week later. Overall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Class. Raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks (and four follow up calls to customer relations), who said that since my agent had booked my Knoxville flight that was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system ""automatically took my booking off"" - I don't know whether this is normal but I've never come across this issue before in all my years of flying. Absolutely awful customer service. BA have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isn't good enough, not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins, which is atrocious.

We called the hotline for assistance and they were very rude and not helpful. We arrived at 8:40pm to catch a 9:10pm flight. We were on a small plane so we had to wait for our valeted bags, run from gate F 23 to a bus to take us to A 23. I attempted to ask the gate agent to radio the other gate to let them know we were on our way. They told me ""we don't hold planes for anyone"" and proceeded to laugh at me and then looked at me with a puzzling stare when I told them we were headed to Ireland. We ran through the airport and made it to the gate at 8:59 as the doors were closing. I was dripping in sweat and good barely breath as I gave the ticket to the gate agent. I said ""I'm sorry it's the airlines fault we are late."" She said ""it most certainly is not!"". I said ""our plane was delayed 1 hour 35 minutes!"". She said ""well it's not my fault!"". If we were not young and in relatively good shape and had some luck with the bus being quick, we would have not made this flight.

"Stockholm to Hong Kong via Helsinki with Finnair. At online check-in, we got seat no. on the first flight to HEL but not on the connecting flight to HKG. We only had about 1 hour transit time. There was only this message to tell us to proceed to transfer service desk. That day after we arrived at HEL, we immediately rushed to the service desk. It was about 22.50 and we were told by the ground staff to proceed to boarding gate about the seat allocation problem. We got through security and passport control. Then there was this major delay (over 8 hours) last minute as in we were informed within the last 30 mins of the scheduled flight departure time. All right, bad luck then. We grabbed some meals then tried to catch up some sleep at airport hotel knowing we had to get up on time to arrive at the airport again at about 6.30am, as we were told to do so in order to catch the delayed flight at 8.30am. Then there was this issue about overbooking. It was at the boarding gate the ground staff, who turned up at about 7.30am, that finally needed to manage this mess of troubles. Apparently this flight was heavily overbooked and there would not be enough seats for all the passengers waiting there at the boarding gate. At the last minute, the ground staff called for volunteer passengers to reschedule their itinerary, within the last hour of the flight departure time, when passengers were mostly tired and stressed by all this hassles. What was this service?? I would not understand. We were not travelling with budget airlines. At last we were among the lucky ones to be able to go on board but I felt sorry for the others stranded. We were going on holiday but all these stress, hassles and tiredness were making it very very bad journey experience indeed.

"  Copenhagen to New York. Wow. I have flown Norwegian consistently for the last 5 years on my trips between the US and Denmark. They have previously been an inexpensive, no frills but polite and attentive experience. The last 2 trips I have taken with them have been nightmares. On one of my arrivals we were left on the tarmac for 3 hours without access to any food or water after an 8.5 hour flight. Opting out of meals, I plan to keep myself sustained for the journey and eat before departure and immediately upon arrival but when you add 3 more hours, it's difficult to pack an unexpected meal in my carry-on. On an NYC-CPH journey I waited 1 hour 45 minutes in a line of 500 people all trying to check into 5 different flights departing with an hour of one another. It was miserable and left no time for the eat before you fly strategy. And while we were all in this ridiculous line, they had a side line for those with just carry on bags where they were weighing them to make sure that all carry ons were under 10kg max before letting them check in with the kiosk, or if they were unlucky, wait in the line to pay $100 for the bag they need to check. This doesn't sound too unreasonable, after all rules are rules.A ridiculous experience and one that will keep me far far away from Norwegian in the future.",Detractor

I don't really have any other complaints as I can't expect too much of a budget airline on a flight of a couple of hours but not being able to sit as a normal person for 2 hours and the cabin crew slamming their cart into my knees (as the only place I could put my legs was the aisle) is not something I'll pay for again.,Detractor

" Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie via Toronto.

I was given an alternative to leave on Thursday instead of scheduled Monday flight, with no concern of how am I supposed to pay for my stay in Sault Ste Marie for additional 3 days, missing work at the same time. No food vouchers, hotel or any other accommodations were offered. No alternative flights were offered. Nor from another city, nor from different airline. Unacceptable treatment of customers, with no effort made whatsoever to rectify the situation. I was left with no alternative but miss work, look for accommodation and pay for food for three days. Every passenger on the flight was treated in the same manner. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. AC replied to my claim, stating that they ""don't reimburse delays due to extreme weather"" and offered me 25% discount on the future flights. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as Porter flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to ""get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there"", as well as the claim that ""my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather"". I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation. Not even mentioning I was already avoiding Air Canada, now I will do everything possible not to fly with them again. Unfortunately, they hold monopoly on flights within the country for the most part.

"  ANA has one of the best business class seats that offer a lot of privacy and comfort. Even for a tall European of 1.85m the seat is long enough to find a comfortable sleeping position. Flight attendants are outstandingly friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or robotic, and from my experience they all speak very good English. Food quality was above average, but although the flight from Tokyo to Sydney is 9.5 hours, main meal service comes on one tray with appetizer and entree served at the same time, which I find not really reasonable. I found breakfast on this route rather bland and meagre, but flight attendants are happy to find some add-ons, e.g. a left-over cheese plate or so.

Flew ICN-SYD in business class - all aspects of this trip and airline seem to have gone downhill since our previous flight on the same route 3+ years ago. Old aircraft with recliner seats in a 2-3-2 configuration - as far as I know this is the only OZ long haul route without newer lie-flat seats in business class. Even though business class was only 3/4 full Asiana would not allocate us seats in the window/aisle seats until airport check-in. We were the last people in the cabin who had their meal order taken and they had run out of western meals - only Korean left for one of us. They did have the main courses left so my husband was offered a steak (no appetiser) served with chopsticks. My main course (fish) was terrible - took one bite and left the rest. Champagne was room temperature and breakfast eggs were cold - why can't airlines serve cold things cold and hot things hot - it's not that hard. Lounge in ICN is looking somewhat worn out and F&B offerings are rock bottom. Last flight for us on this airline particularly considering their recent safety record (another landing accident in Japan last week).

I took an intercontinental return flight from Madrid to Havana. It was a daytime flight and except from the comfort of the seat this was an incredibly bad experience. The service was by far the worst service I've had in an airplane. The crew were very unfriendly and not co-operative at all. With dinner you'll get 1 drink. Apart from water or orange juice you have to buy all other drinks. The crew started serving food at a slow pace afterwards they came 3 times with coffee/tea and immediately afterwards the whole crew started to have dinner themselves. The stewards/stewardesses also didn't respond at all to the service lights you can switch on at you seat. I don't expect much from airplane food but this was one of the worst I've had. Air Europa also doesn't provide a personal entertainment system. It is still done by some general screens from the ceiling and was only broadcasting a movie in Spanish. Worst of all the movie was restarted 3 times and wasn't finished in the end. On the return way we had to wait an 1.5 hrs to get checked in. There was an enormous queue all the way through the departure hall. About half of the passengers still had to check in after us. So we asked for window seats (25% of the seats). We were told these weren't available anymore. So we asked for Aisle seats (50% of the seats). The ground stewardess told us she would fix this. In the end from the 10 people we were traveling with only 1 had an aisle seat and the rest were scattered through the whole plane on centre seats. Luckily this was a night flight and we were all tired. So we slept most of the way and didnt have to deal with the service or Spanish movie.

"The Polaris disaster with United Airlines. Washington IAD to Zurich on a 767-400ER. Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a â€œpolar bearâ€ teddy bear, so there's no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didn't guarantee that I'd have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. I've never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when he's in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed â€œwhat would you likeâ€ rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink. Now a piece of the siding underneath where the table is stowed is unhinged and flapping loosely. Who's got a piece of tape? To top it off, my appetizer was frozen (including the salad) and the bread was cold and stale. Good luck, UA, with Polaris. So far, not impressed. Same miserable UA crew with bad attitudes (although the Cabin Service Director was polite and apologetic when I told him what his colleague had said to me about the call button). This has been a rude awakening after regularly flying Qatar Airways for the last two years.

Our party of 6 booked Premium Economy Singapore - Vancouver 1 July and back Seattle - Singapore 20 July both via Taipei. No issues with the flight out on 1 July to Vancouver. Return leg Seattle - Taipei in Premium Economy but we were put in Economy Taipei - Singapore. We paid for and our eticket itinerary clearly stated Premium Economy all the way. Thus we felt short changed when we discovered we were to be in Economy on the Taipei - Singapore leg. In fact we changed our original date from 19 to 20 Jul as we were told by the agent that there was no Premium Economy configuration on the earlier date. We had no problems when we flew the same itinerary in 2011 but this incident has certainly left us with a bad impression of how EVA Air treats its customers.

I missed my connection at DFW (after rushing to get to the gate that is always on the other far side) so they put me on a later flight. That was also delayed because the crew was late. I always try to pay extra for seats with leg room due to being a little claustrophobic and did so on both flights. My BNA to DFW seat was 16A an exit row seat. So I thought and so it said on my boarding pass. I get on the plane and it is in fact not an exit row. Okay, I'm irritated at this point, but, still going with it. The lady who helped with the flight (she was nice) from DFW to ONT put me in seat 10-A. No biggie. Window seat right(?) and I understood that I was a late passenger. I get on the plane and although it is next to the fusulage, there is no window AND the there was less leg room than the normal seats. It literally looks like there was an exit door there at some point and they just covered it up and threw a row of seats in. I'm done with AA period.",Detractor
" Houston to Salt Lake City. I hate flying with United Airlines. Literally every time I miss my connection flight. I would never pay my own money to fly this airline.

"  Paris to Hong Kong. Well it seems the Europe run flight crew are a bit slack compared to the Sydney and HK crew. But first, the Premium Economy section toilet was broken, so we had to go way down the back of the plane and stand in long queues to use the loo. There was no salt and pepper. We asked, they said ok. It never came. We asked for water and got two cups of warm water. We were told there was no ice cream choice, chocolate or nothing, and then they served strawberry to the rear. They did not distribute immigration forms for Hong Kong, which delayed our processing, and which is inexcusable slackness. The tea is poor. The seats have a rigid divider, so when I needed to exit from my window seat I could not get past the man lying all the way back in the row in front and refusing to lift his seat for me. For all that I arrived in OK shape and had a safe and comfortable trip. Check in was efficient and friendly, I was a priority client needing a wheelchair and all of that was fine, albeit with a few reminders to the crew that a wheelchair was required on arrival in HK. I needed oxygen half way across, due to the long walk back from the loo and the struggle under the seat as described above, as I have a respiratory condition, the air was thin and I was severely oxygen depleted, and the crew were marvelous about that. The seats were very comfortable for 12 hours (unlike the business class seats, which were bad for the backside, on our trip over to Europe).",Passive

On my flight to Athens from Frankfurt I had to pay an extra fee of 60 euros to check in my cabin bag exceeding the weight limit by 2kg. I was not the only one getting this treatment. Not that the bag would have been bigger in volume than the one allowed, only it wasn't the correct form but would have still fit the overhead compartment just fine. Also a couple of people who had bought tax free products at the airport and now had to check in their bags because the extra plastic/paper bag they were carrying also had to be in their cabin bag . The service onboard was standard and the flight arrived on time, all of which I couldn't enjoy after the experience I had at the gate.",Detractor

In my case i did pre purchase the ham and cheese baguette from the Saga Kitchen which was tasty but over priced. FAs' very friendly. Aircraft were clean, and modern. Boeing 767 from LHR to KEF was excellent. Newly refurbished plane with big modern IFE. My only complaint is that of the gate staff at KEF. Very poor communication and they appeared to not really know what was going on.

"  I'll start with the flight. Our flight took off at 5:45pm and we landed in Cuba after 1am. We paid extra for the elite plus package. The 3rd row we had on the way down was ideal. We got the first row on the way back, it was the worst, you couldn't move the arm rest and it's annoying to have no place to put your bags. On the way down, we had a rowdy, loud couple who never stopped talking. It was annoying until around 11pm and just ignorant after that as it would have been nice to have a little nap given we weren't getting to our hotel until 3-4am. The flight attendants did nothing to get them to be quiet, rather, they participated in the shenanigans. If I had my kids with me, I would have been extremely upset. On the way back, the same couple was on the plane and were still talking the whole way home. We left Cuba after 3am so everyone wanted to sleep and these people never shut up. Again, no one from sunwing said anything to them. Grow a back bone for your other passengers flight comfort and say something to these people please! As for the resort, it was amazing. However, Sunwing was paid by us for a 7 day stay. We really got more like 6 and a few hours because of the time our flight came in. I would recommend you ask Sunwing about this. Our check in time for our resort was 3pm March 2nd. We hadn't even left Edmonton until 5:45pm that same day. Our flight home was at 3:35am on March 10th. We had to vacate our room at 12pm on March 9th meaning we had no room to stay in for 11 hours before the bus came to take us to the airport. When we spoke to the resort, they said sometimes when Sunwing does this, they pay for the room or negotiate late check out. They did nothing of the sort. The resort however took care of us and we checked out at 4pm and were offered a courtesy room in case we wanted to freshen up before the flight. That was 100% because we spoke to a wonderful man named Oscar who helps run the resort. When I went to the front desk, they basically said that's what sunwing paid for so if we hadn't found Oscar, we would have been screwed. I've stayed once in Cuba before and had the exact same flight situation but we got to keep our room until we left. This is why I will book through that company in the future. I've had so many issues with Sunwing that I haven't booked with them in 4 years and I never will again. They're the worst!",Detractor

I had asked him about the gate number and he replied to me gate is not allocated yet. I went to food court for coffee and I did not receive any notification from check-in staff, suddenly I saw the gate number on information screen and gate number was final call. I did not miss my flight. I rushed to the gate and I went to aircraft along with other passengers by bus instead of aero bridge.

"  I've always been big on traveling but since mid 2013 I have been taking around 8-20 flights a year, domestic and international, mostly for business purposes. Out of all the airlines I have taken (and I fly to some remote places in the world) American Airlines have managed to be the most consistent with their lack of customer care and disorganization and just a huge shame to what you would expect of one of the biggest airlines coming out of the US. Canceling and delaying is something that happens so often that I have become shocked when their flights go as planned, they offer no compensation of course for those delays and time and energy consuming horrible experiences that everyone hates. American Airlines offer no canceling/bumping a flight like 90% of the time, just zero effort to even try and show just a little bit of courtesy toward the customer in general.",Detractor

Gatwick to Stockholm and back with Norwegian and would fly with them again. They don't try to scam you with paying extra for this that and the other.

The WiFi worked well and was complimentary in business. The entertainment system works well, with a nice big and clear screen, but the movie selections were not great. The seat does go all the way flat, but it is difficult to adjust how you like in between that and upright. For some reason, there is no independent control just for recline. There is plenty of space for stuff you want to use during the flight so you don't need to keep reaching for the overhead bin. The flight from Dublin to Brussels was less good. There is no business class on this flight. Even though my end-to-end ticket was for business class, on this flight they don't even provide water or tea for free. This flight was also significantly delayed, by ATC, so that really wasn't their fault.",Promoter
" The second onward connection from Delhi to San Francisco was scheduled in the evening and on this sector surprisingly not all the seats were full as the airline has increased the frequency of flights to SFO. Boarding happened on time and departure was ahead of the scheduled time which was a big plus. Once airborne on this 17 hour flight, the crew regularly looked after the passengers with food and drinks at regular intervals. At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. I believe along with DEL-JFK, this flight is also one of Air India's best products as it reduces the travel time considerably and the service is warm and hospitable.

I was able to switch flights to land in New Bern NC rather than OAJ, but then I had to rent a vehicle to drive an additional hour to get to my destination.

"I just flew Rouge for the first and likely the last time YUL- CAN. The first thing you notice are the seats. I am 6'0"" tall and found the seats to be very cramped uncomfortable and claustrophobic. If the person in front of you chooses to recline your eye-to-seatback distance becomes very small. This situation may be barely tolerable for flights under 2 hrs but for the 4.5 hrs to CAN it was tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. The next thing you notice is that there is no traditional entertainment system. It is WiFi only and currently appears limited to iPad and some Windows devices. I have an Android tablet and therefore was not able to access their movie selection. What is surprising here is that an entertainment system that is designed around a bring-your-own-device concept provides no AC or USB access to power/charge your device.

We had no trouble connecting to in-flight entertainment during our flight. Our son has an allergy to peanuts and having read the reviews on this site we were concerned for the cleanliness of the seats (potential cross contamination causing an allergic reaction) and the competence of the staff. Anyone with serious allergies will understand the level of worry that comes without access to medical assistance for a long period. On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated.

" Kupang to Singapore via Surabaya, Jakarta. The check in process was smooth and easy. The flight departed on time from Kupang to Surabaya but when departing from Surabaya to Jakarta there were slight delay. When the aircraft reached Jakarta, it was parked at gate that was very far from the transfer desk and baggage collection. As the connection at Jakarta was only 1hr 30min and the delay cause it to be less than 1 hr transit, we need to rush at Jakarta and walk long way to the international terminal. From Jakarta to Singapore, the boarding was on time but the pushed back was very long, we wait at the aircraft for an hour. As Jakarta Airport was very crowded, we finally took off after 1 hour 30 minutes delay. For A330 i think Garuda has reduced some crew members as the serving of food was slow and due to turbulence, the food cannot be served temporarily.

"  Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit.

"This is a review for SAS flight from Chicago to Copenhagen. I checked in online and was able to switch my seat from the assigned one to window seat toward the front. However, SAS online check-in system was funny and did not send me any confirmation email nor the boarding pass, therefore I had to confirm this in person at ORD. The staff at the check-in counters were very helpful and accmmodated all my requests without any annoyance. Boarding went smoothly. Initially the cabin temperature was very hot but was adjusted to the more comfortable level quickly. We departed about 30 minutes behind schedule but arrived at CPH 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Taxiing to the gate at CPH was very short and very quickly passengers were allowed to deplane. In-flight services : the seat was comfortable with ample leg room, despite an old cabin. FA's were all very friendly, but the food was terrible. The worst part of this trip was that about 30% of the IFE (mine included) were completely out of order. Fortunately it was a red-eye flight and I was able to get away with sleeping. However, this was a huge drawback and I would've given this flight a score of 8 or 9 had the IFE been working.",Passive
"  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Air India. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours. Air India have wasted my time, money, and have shown themselves to be a company with a culture of complete indifference towards their customers. I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time. Air India deprived me of sleep, wasted my time, and also my money, for something that could've been taken care of easily and left me a satisfied customer.",Detractor

 Detroit to Las Vegas. I vowed to never use Spirit Airlines after my last experience using them 4 years ago. That experience required that my flight was delayed due to their employees neglecting to come to work. Missing my appointment was detrimental to my employment and using a low quality travel provider was a poor choice on my part and I accepted the responsibility of my choice to use them. When I checked ticket costs for my most recent trip the spirit cost appeared exceptionally low so I made the mistake of booking with them again. Spirit charges fees for checked bags and higher fees for carry on bags. I attempted to use their online platform to pay the $45 fee each way for a carry on bag.

Some of the crew on certain legs were fantastic while others fail to make a mark remaining within borders of being professional and nothing else. The crew on the Sao Paulo to Dubai leg were fabulous - very warm and attentive. On ultra long haul flights, the seats seem to recline a lot more on a lie-flat arrangement.

Some of the cabins had the StarLight belongs only to Emirates - bringing a great mood in flight. Emirates, while being a great airline, has inconsistent cabin service onboard which is surprising. The ICE entertainment system was spectacular - the best in the skies. What I give it to Emirates for is their food and it's quality - marvelous! There are 3 meals on the 14 hour leg - in addition to main meals, there is a light bite service. Due to the lack of on demand dining, they have snacks in the galley in between for the hungry.

Once off the lane it took 45 minutes to deliver our luggage in the airport and the airport says it is the airline's responsibility to make their 20 minute advertised limit. Do not fly Sunwing!

JFK-AMM-JFK. We had an infant and asked for a row with access to bassinet. At check-in we were told we had a bassinet seat and when we boarded we discovered that we did not have access to one. The crew were not helpful rude and even threatened to offload me and my family and void our tickets. Very poor experience.,Detractor
"First time flyer with Ryanair and must say, very impressed on flight from Birmingham to Dublin. Perfect for short haul flights, no problems at all with check in, boarding, no delays going out but coming back very short delay but Pilot still got us back within scheduled time. Cabin crew were friendly both journeys. Flight was smooth considering bad weather conditions and for a nervous flyer made my flight more enjoyable. Would fly with Ryanair again for sure.",Promoter
"  Moscow to Yuzhno Sakhalinsk. On check in at Moscow the staff were rude and refused to check me in as one of my bags as it weighed 24kg instead of 23kg, even though my 2nd check in luggage weighed 12kg. They told me to take 1kg out or pay 2000rur or they wouldnt let me fly. Out of the 46kg I was entitled to take I only had 36kg and ended up having to take 1kg out of my luggage and hand carry it onboard. There was only 1 person scanning boarding passes for economy passengers with no help and no proper queue so all customers were just pushing to get to the desk to board. This was highly unorganised and not pleasant. We had to board on a bus even though we were flying on a full B777 while smaller A320's and B737's sat at the gate making the boarding process very uncomfortable . The plane was one of Aeroflot's oldest B777's. The USB charger was broken at my seat and one of the toilets was out of order. They hadn't changed the entertainment from April to May even though they provided the May entertainment guide. The food was terrible and they ran out of the food selection I wanted due to the way they were serving food (back to front rows). For breakfast I got a buckwheat porridge however it wasnt a porridge at all, just a tray full of cooked but dry buckwheat. They don't serve any alcohol on an 8hr flight - if you want some you have to pay for it and if you want a snack you also have to pay for it. Overall Aeroflot provided poor ground and air service and used an old plane for a long flight. I have flown Aeroflot before and sometimes they can be ok, but on this particular case they were poor.",Detractor

"We booked a one way flight from Lima Peru to Denver Colorado. The price was okay and I do like the idea of paying for only what you use i.e. checked bags or carry on bags. However in our situation we have two stops in the US one in Fort Lauderdale and the other in Chicago since we will be changing planes in Chicago Spirit is charging us again for our extra bags. So now we have to pay for our checked bags twice even though we are on the same airlines and our flight to Chicago is a connecting flight to Denver. Also be sure to read all about the bag weights and size restrictions. We just had a wonderful surprise that we are only allowed one bag at 40lbs from Peru. The ""Customer Service"" agent at Spirit told me it's a limitation at the Lima airport. Which is false other Airlines allow customer two bags each. Imagine moving from Peru with only one checked bag. I really wish I would have read some of these reviews before booking Spirit never again will I fly Spirit.",Detractor

"Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree.",Detractor
 New York JFK to Delhi. One of the worst experiences ever. The media consoles didn't work. I had the longest flight ever. We have complained them about the media consoles. They didn't function till 2 hours the flight has started. They have repeatedly rebooted the consoles and even after that it didn't work. There wasn't any communication. The food is also not up to the mark. By the end of the flight the toilets wouldn't flush. I will never fly by them again.,Detractor
This airline has to be the worst I have ever traveled with. I don't know if it's because of the holidays or if they are just always like this. Their tickets might be cheap but you pay for it in every other thing that they can think of to charge you for. Don't bother bringing carry on thinking you'll save money 50$ to check carry on. Don't forget they charge you for a small cup of water. That's not really what irks me though - it's the fact that this airline doesn't seem to have anything together. Everyone of my flights were delayed by an hour to 2 hours for random and not clearly explained reasons. Everyone is fairly rude and not reassuring. Not only have these delays inconvenience myself they also inconvenience the people coming to get me from the airport. All in all poor service poor comfort (the seats don't recline at all). Terrible prices for luggage and food. I am completely disappointed with this airline and I don't think I will ever use them again.,Detractor
Flew Melbourne to London and back last week. It was the worst trip I have had there and back. The food was very poor we were watching the trays after every meal getting packed away and they were hardly touched so we were not the only ones who thought so the breakfasts were shockingly bad. The flight crew from Dubai were very unprofessional complaining out loud about the airline and their shifts. Qantas advertise on there own page about enjoying a hot chocolate this is only offered once each way from Melbourne to London and Back. No ice creams offered as advertised. The self serve snack bar food is plain and boring offering plain biscuits nuts and small cake bars. First and last time we fly with this airline in the airlines troubled times they should be doing so much better will never forget the awful meals provided for every meal.,Detractor
" Indigo flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai. Due to the flight schedule modifications due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts, I had to do a last minute booking on Indigo which came at a steep price but as I was required to travel had no other choice. The check-in was a breeze and boarding / departure started on time. The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch. A very pleasant flight experience indeed. Thank you Indigo.",Promoter

When I go to airport the next day I found out that one was canceled and they booked a different flight. Six hours later they tell me that one will be delayed. After that they put me on different airline so that I could make it to my pool tournament, where I missed the first match. On day of return flight found out that one was canceled. Spent 5 hours on hold to get put on different airline so I could try and get home for work. When I told them how much money I lost with the pool tournament and one day lost work they offer me a $50 voucher to use, that was the third one they offered.

Aug 1st. Flight DY7087 from Arlanda to Los Angeles. Almost 8 hours delay. Scheduled departure time was 1400 and actual departure was 2145. We had driven 3 hours to Arlanda airport to check-in at 11am to be told that due to technical reasons the flight was delayed 2 hours until 1610. This then became 1840 and subsequently 2040. The announcements were made on the departure notice board. There was not one Norwegian Air employee to speak to at the airport. Given a 100 kroner meal voucher which barely covered the cost of a sandwich. The whole experience was a nightmare and we eventually got to LAX at midnight instead of 1615. The cabin staff were very polite and apologetic telling me that Norwegian Air long haul flights have a lot of problems and are very often delayed. I checked out the historical data for flights from Arlanda to Los Angeles and found that there were delays on 5 out of 6 flights the previous week with average delays of over 3 hours and in some instances cancellations. This was our second similar bad experience in a year with Norwegian. Never again and the flying public should be warned.,Detractor
"I flew Qantas from Melbourne to London via Dubai return. Having not flown Business on a Qantas long-haul flight for some time, I have been left feeling disappointed. Of all the things that stick out in my mind, it is the poor service of the Business class crew. Maybe my expectations were off but at no point was I made to feel special. Examples include only 75% of the cabin being offered the bed turn-down service - I'm not sure why I and a few others were excluded from this. Being handed a bottle of water while the crew was looking and talking to someone else (I found this particularly rude). It was just about shoved in my face. Not having my meal order being taken while the person directly beside me did, and then being told by the crew ""oh your order isn't on the list I assumed you weren't eating, let me see what I can do"" as if she was doing me a favour! These are all small insignificant things, but when you drop $7K+ on a flight you expect better. The seat is comfortable enough, although I note Qantas has a 2-2-2 config versus Emirates 1-2-1. The interior of drab cabin colours aren't particularly appealing either for a 22 hours of flying. No WiFI (which I can live without, yet other airlines have it). Inflight entertainment was satisfactory, but Qantas policy doesn't allow you to bring out the screen until you are in the air. Based on my experience I will certainly not be choosing Qantas again for long haul flights. If you can get an Emirates flight for the same or similar price then you'd be mad not to go with Emirates.",Passive
" Brussels to London Heathrow. It was supposed to be a short, 50 minute flight, but it ended up taking over 2 hours. When the gate was announced in the airport, the moment we arrived we saw that the plane would depart at 9:55 and not the 9:40 scheduled time. The reason for this was apparently ""changing a tire"", although oddly the plane was right in front of us the whole time and no tire was changed. As 9:55 loomed, the time of departure was again changed to 10:10, again for the same reason. We finally boarded the plane at around 10 a.m, local time, and departed at about 10:30 a.m. A gentleman sitting behind me lost his connecting flight because of the delays that we experienced, and the flight attendant was rude with him when he asked for help. I was content with the flight comfort wise. The leg space was surprisingly good. I am 1.87 cm tall and i could stretch my legs. Same cannot be said with the service whilst on board. I tried to buy coffee and a sandwich, but they only accepted credit card and no debit card 'because of a fault in the system'. When i offered to pay cash in British Pounds, they refused. Not quite sure why, but it left me without breakfast. Also note that if you are a non-EU citizen landing in the UK, you will need to fill an immigration landing card, but bring a pen on board because to quote the flight attendant ""we have pens but are not allowed to give them to passengers"". All in all, it was an average experience. I fly this route almost twice a month, but it has always been with British Airways. My first experience with Brussels Airlines, and I think there are things they can work on and improve.",Passive

"  Have been flying on ANA either in economy or business three times a year for the last ten years between Honolulu and Narita. Whether in business or economy, inflight service from their FAs is consistently excellent. Food can be hit or miss but generally of high standards but not quite up to par with what is offered on mainland US flights. My only complaint is that with the Honolulu flight, upon arrival at Tokyo Narita, we are often parked away from the terminal and have to disembark by stairs and then get herded on to buses to be taken to the terminal. This has increasingly become the norm with the Honolulu to Tokyo Narita flight. On my latest flight, I complained to the FA about this as I have arthritis and it is difficult and painful for me to descend stairs with a carry on. She apologized for this and explained that ANA does not have control over gate assignments, but she did offer to assist me with my carry on. I declined as I felt that it is not a FAs job to assist passengers with carrying their luggage. As ANA is a flagship airline at Tokyo Narita, this should not be happening.",Promoter

We booked direct with the airline, which was cheaper than any aggregator sites - we had intended to fly premium economy, but when booking managed to get a business class outbound journey for almost the same price. The experience was excellent - from the business class SilverKris Lounge at LHR to the onboard service. The plane we were on had the relatively new business class seats, which were superbly comfortable and afforded a truly relaxing journey, with a good range of entertainment, food and drink (we used the 'Book the Cook' to have our own choice from the extensive menu). The wifi was also reasonable even if a 30MB allowance is meagre for a near 12.5 hour flight!

All in all a very bad experience flying with Air China and I would definitely not recommend them to anyone,",Detractor
 Barcelona to Gatwick. The flight was smooth and we landed earlier in London Gatwick. The screens were not or something? The flight attendants were not so polite this time.,Passive
AZ 681/680 from/to Buenos Aires to Rome in Magnifica Class. Fantastic seat configuration 1+2+1. Flight on time nice Aerolineas (Skyteam) Business lounge in new terminal C of EZE. Captain at the door welcoming all J pax. The Chief Purser introduced herself personally to all pax in J. Very nice Bulgari amenity kit. Lunch was served with individual placemat. Flight attendants move with a trolley and prepare the dishes for you upon request. Interesting Italian regional menus. Top Italian wines. 3 pastas and 2 main courses of meat and fish. Nespresso coffee (finally on board) pastries cheeses and fruit salads. Dish presentation can probably be improved but the quality of the food was impressive. Entertainment good but not extraordinary. The TV monitors are not last generation and quality of image is not state of the art. Too few blockbusters too many retro movies. Night open buffet with everything you need. Breakfast prior to arrival very good but not 5 star. Cabin attendants attentive and smiley. Good communication from the cockpit. Landed on time in Rome. Baggage came out 45 minutes after but this is not AZ fault. Same thing and the coming back flight apart from a minor communication from the cockpit.,Promoter
" Christchurch to Sydney. Cabin Manager had her birthday on the day we flew so champers all 'round plus it was my 60th so a lot of fun. Sadly let down by extraordinarily bad seating, the seats are a nightmare for people with lower back issues and I was almost crying from pain by the time we landed. Could never fly longer than a trans-Tasman route with them. I can only recommend the airline based on their crew, I would warn against the airline if you have any sort of issue with your back.",Detractor
"We had an okay experience with Ukraine International, from Dubai to Kiev and the flight was on time. Seats were comfy. They didn't serve any meals despite being on a six-hour flight. The biggest turnoff is not with UIA but in Kiev Airport (KBP). Transfer passengers had to wait for 30 minutes before the Transfer Desk opened despite the fact that we all arrived at 8.30am (and it's not an ungodly hour).",Passive
LHR-JNB-CPT. Upper deck on A380. 2x3x2 arrangement far from ideal for the trio in the middle although dividing up the club world cabin helps. Seats otherwise identical to usual BA business class. Window seats are best because of lockers at the side. Take-off remarkably quiet and smooth. Dinner service quick - in marked contrast to recent Emirates flight on A380. Food actually very good including a main course salad with 'warmed salmon' which was as good as in any restaurant. Slow disembarkation at JNB. Huge confusion about whether luggage had to be retrieved and re-checked in (check in at LHR informed us it was ticketed all the way to our final destination) and where we had to go for domestic transfer. Eventually arrived in excellent SLOW lounge 45 mins after leaving plane. 2 hr flight on 737 to CPT uneventful and quick baggage retrieval.,Passive
" Philadelphia to Cancun. They are the most untrained staff I have encountered. I have a valid I-551 stamp - temporary green card on my passport, the crew refused to let me boarding. My friend had to drive 2h to the airport to give me the actual card. After I got back I check with my lawyer, it is valid for a year starting 04/2018, so by law I'm allowed to travel with it. They charged me $100 to go on the next flight. not only do they waste my time, that I end up with a transfer flight with 10 layover flight instead of the 4h direct flight, plus the extra hotel out of my pocket.",Detractor
LIN-FCO-IST-FCO-LIN. Check-in at Linate was done over the phone so I just had to pick my boarding pass at the counter. Polite staff at the gate changed my seat on the FCO-IST to a better selection. LIN-FCO was a great flight everything smooth and good service. Flight to IST was terrible rude staff and poor food availability. Only a cookie for a 2 hr international flight. Return flight was even worse rude flight attendant and very unhelpful. Service still below standards and lacking. FCO-LIN was a delight compared to the previous flight. Flight crew was totally on another level making the flight enjoyable. No consistency on this airline and should also focus not only on their major route between Milan and Rome.,Passive
" Cincinnati to Calgary. I didn't realize my passport was expired until I was in the airport to check in, while my families' are still active, they left without me. I was in a great disappointment since we are traveling to Canada I couldn't leave without a passport. One of the ground crews showed her empathy and kindly lead me to the special help crews. They talked and came up with a plan, since it was early in the morning and we are close to Chicago (~8am), they tried to help me get to Chicago Passport Agency (closed at 3pm) and have my passport renewed on the same day. So that they booked me a ticket to Chicago and rebooked my trips for the next early morning leaving from Chicago all for free! Since I needed two 2""x 2"" pictures and form DS 82 before I go to the CPA, staff helped me to find a nearest place where I could get those documents, and she even walked me down to the ground transportation. It was a long day and lots of running, but I was so lucky everything worked so smoothly, I was at Calgary just about 12 hours later than our original arrival time. My trip wouldn't happen without the help of these staff. Delta has super sweet staff and fare price.",Promoter
I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work. This is just one of many times I have had trouble with this airline I will not be flying again.,Detractor
LHR-TPE-LHR. Very comfortable wide seats - best I've encountered in economy class. Flights both ways were on schedule. Crew were friendly and helpful.

April 11 Hong Kong to San Francisco via Beijing. Good equipment good seating pretty good AVOD but mediocre service. First of all there is a woeful lack of understandable English. The inflight announcements challenge the imagination. Secondly the handsome menu suggests a pleasant dining experience that does not materialize. (On our outbound flight there were no menus so the flight attendants brought out the frozen dinners and peeled back to foil so we could guess what we were to have.) Drinks are not offered before dinner rather with dinner with no offer of a refill. Finally after the crew dispenses water for the long flight they disappear unless you press the flight attendant button. Unless the price is really right I would avoid Air China since there are so many good Asian carriers.,Detractor
" Seattle to San Diego. Worst flight ever. It was an absolute circus. First, the flight attendants were a half hour late. Then, after about 45 minutes of sitting on the runway, a man in an orange vest came on board holding a small plastic cover. He then asked us to stand up and help him find out where the missing part came from. Totally unprofessional. He never found the origin of the mysterious piece and then left the plane shortly after inconveniencing all of us. I might as well be flying spirit.",Detractor
  Bahrain to Cebu via Hong Kong in business class. Bahrain to HKG on a newer aircraft with good clean toilets and a very efficient crew. Food was very average and had a hard time asking for additional bread with the meal. Desserts are very poor choice and would have been better off in economy. IFE is very good and a good up to date movies. Flatbed seat is narrow compared to Qatar Airways but had good legroom when lying flat. HKG to CEB was sadly delayed as they decided to change the plane and once we boarded this seemed an old plane as the interior was very tired had seen better days. I just decided to sleep on this route. Cathay Pacific need to up their game in terms of food and the quality and quantity served in business class - its way below Qatar Airways and Emirates.,Passive

The best US domestic airline service available. Family flew Chicago to Las Vegas via San Francisco return. Staff pleasant and helpful at both ends. Interior of plane was new and clean. Entertainment system in seatbacks is superb - some movies and visuals are pay per view but the entire music selection is free. It's good to order food and drinks from your seatback and have them delivered to your seat. Staff wear interesting uniforms and pilots greet on arrival and departure. They offered the cheapest fares for the route and San Francisco is a fabulous airport in which to spend a couple of hours.,Promoter
I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years.

Flew from Edmonton to Huatulco with no problems at all. On time and arrived early. When we left the flight was delayed by 20 minutes but we arrived right on time. Entertainment was great going down but coming home only 1 movie with 2 shows. Not very good for a 5.5 hour flight. Coming home turbulence was the worst I have ever experienced. The pilot and flight crew did their best in those conditions. Excellent hot meals and snacks. Upgraded to the Elite Plus and would do so again. Overall the best airline we have flown with so far.,Promoter
"Flew from Doha to London on QR 003, June 24th. Very impressive check in area. Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates. However, I would still choose to fly on Qatar Airways since they are a member of One World Alliance and based on their on board service experienced.",Promoter

" My family and I were flying home from Hawaii on American Airlines. My 7 month old son was on my lap. Our flight flew through a weather system (that had grounded many other airlines) and we experienced turbulence for 3.5 hours. At one point the turblance was so severe that my son went flying through the air and landed on his head. My head was cut open and I got a concussion, and some crew were injured and were unable to work the rest of the flight. The only thing they offered was a dry cleaning voucher upon arrival, they had paramedics at the gate waiting for the crew, but never offered medical help to passengers.

" Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapÃ©s for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie. For the price, though, EK remains an excellent choice on this route.",Promoter
" Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca. I must say that this airline is very nice, and I have no hesitations using it in the future. Online service is a bit weird, because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly, the system selects them for you, and there seems to be no logic behind the selection. Moscow to Casablanca (5 hours 30 minutes, on-time) Check-in was a breeze. The flight was operated by a B737-800 with a nice modern interior and mood lighting, and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats - which has tons of legroom and very comfortable old-fashioned thick seat profile. Pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat - a rare sight! The flight was half-empty, so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone. The staff were polite and quite friendly, but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service - which is awfully long for a daytime flight. The meals - full trays with salads, desserts, bread and a hot main dish - were delicious, especially the pre-ordered seafood meal, even if the presentation was a bit lacking. They also had complimentary Moroccan wine in small glass bottles, which was very classy, as well as great in taste. Surprisingly, they served one more meal around an hour before landing, which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger. This is the first time I felt so full after the economy class flight, and that's a very rare thing nowadays. The plane had no personal entertainment or power ports, so consider bringing your own. Marrakech-Casablanca (40 minutes, on-time). Check-in was very fast once again, but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats, since she apparently did not have access to the system, and I have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion. The flight on an ATR72 was almost empty, with only 11 passengers, and the ATR72 was the most comfortable plane of its category I ever took. A lot of legroom once again. This flight features zero service, not even drinks, which I found surprising - they could have at least provided water. Not a big deal, considering it's just a short hop. Casablanca airport is not a great place for transit, but not the worst one I've been to (Rome Fiumicino, I'm looking at you). Long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere, but the waiting times were actually very small. Casablanca-Moscow (5 hours 40 minutes). The flight to Moscow was operated by a similar B737-800 and was jam-packed with transit passengers from Nigeria, and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized, with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding. Once onboard, I tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change, but he told us to wait until after take-off. I asked another one, and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful, and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable. Then we switched seats with some fellow passengers, that have also been separated by the weird Royal Air Maroc seat assignment system, and ended up in the bulkhead row. The service was similar to the first flight, but this time they even provided amenity kits - with eye masks and socks, and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of Singapore Airlines, for example. The food and wine were great again, and the luggage arrived safely.",Promoter

OSL-IST-AGP return February/March 2015. OSL-IST on B738 aircraft. Flight more than 80% full. Cramped seating in economy. I moved to a row of 3 vacant seats were I could sleep after the meal service. The same applies for the AGP-IST sector on B738 aircraft. IST-AGP on A321-200. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight was almost 100% full. My seat was in an emergency exit row and so the legroom was very good. The same applies for the IST-OSL sector A321-200 aircraft and seated in an emergency exit row. I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option. In addition the friendly and efficient staff the service standards catering in-flight entertainment and onboard comfort on Turkish Airlines (apart from seat pitch) were top notch. The duty free shopping and dining opportunities at IST airport were an added plus. I definitely recommend Turkish Airlines.,Promoter

On the 4 hour delay flight (to IAD) there were only around 20 of us left and FA's did their level best to help us all out and make us comfortable. I think they were on the 12th hour of a long day.

Turns out it was 2 degrees in Toronto with no snow or winter weather warnings. The issue as it turned out was a check-in system failure. They did not offer any apologies refreshments or even worse any explanation. Every person we spoke to at the resort kept telling us their flights were delayed and some people were told after they had checked out of their rooms.

Leaving from Toronto, helpful staff at check-in. Egyptair uses Air Canada lounge, which is average in service, overall comfortable. The plane to Cairo was quite dated, seat missing some parts, doesn't fully recline, and with a very very dirty screen. The plane back was better. For entertainment, Egypt Air has good new movies, but the system is not set properly to tell you which movie is on what channel. It just displays icons ""movie 1, movie 2, movie 3"". They provided a menu on the way to Cairo, but not on the way back. Food was reasonable on the way to Cairo, but unfortunately of very poor quality on the way back.

Lounge at HND was overcrowded, wi-fi slow, no seats available, wines out of stock, etc. Business class passengers were boarded as cattle as we were very rudely urged to hurry up. No FA at the plane door! We entered aircraft and seated without any welcome or support.

We had Air France tickets from Malaga to JFK and back from MEX connecting flights to/from Paris with Air Europa. Air Europa does not provide 24-hour online check-in. We arrived 80 minutes prior to departure at check-in in Malaga to find a huge queue that moved very slowly. 3 check-in staff only ours was rather unpleasant and grumpy. With 20 minutes to go for departure we were running to security leaving behind about 30 more passengers waiting to be checked-in. Arrived at the gate to be told to rush onto the plane. Onboard the most uncomfortable airline seat old and worn and hardly reclineable. They are also too short so half your thighs don't fit the seat and it inclines downwards so one has the unpleasant feeling of sliding off! Despite the delay we made our connection in Paris. On the return we checked-in online via Aeromexico (still all on AF tickets) but the Air Europa connection Paris-Malaga did not yield seat assignments nor boarding passes. At check-in in MEX we were told they could not help us because when you check-in online this apparently messes up the boarding pass/seating process on Air Europa. Once in Paris AF staff at the connection counter finally printed boarding passes for Air Europe. Yet again the seats were very uncomfortable and old and barely acceptable for a 2-hour flight. Staff just like on the outbound were very indifferent. If at all possible I would avoid Air Europa in the future. I can handle unpleasant staff but I would avoid them purely because of the discomfort of the seats on their B737 that seem to be at least 20 years old.,Detractor

"Nice new A321 aircraft, friendly crew, flight on time - short 1 hour 20 minute flight. The aircraft had overhead screens but they were only really used for the safety video (which curiously they only do in English and then ask passengers who speak one of their three main languages to ask the crew if they have questions). Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason.

"After years of collecting credit card points we decided to use them to fly first class from Toronto to Hawaii and back. We had to go with what was provided. The first flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was in first class on Air Canada. We had a ""pod"" type seat which reclined flat. We were provided with comfortable pillows and a comforter. We had our own individual screen and could watch movies, tv, etc. The food was great and service equally as good. It was everything we had imagined first class would be. We had the same first class treatment from Los Angeles back to Toronto. The polar opposite is true of our United Airlines portion from Los Angeles to Hawaii. The plane is old and first class only means wider seats that recline slightly more than economy with more leg room but extremely uncomfortable to try and sleep in. Besides the food, the only extra we got was a paper thin blanket - no pillows, no screens, no music, nothing. You have to download the app if you want to watch something or listen to music. What if you don't have a smart phone or don't want to watch a movie on it? The flight to Hawaii was bad enough but unfortunately we were stuck with United Airlines on the overnight flight from Hawaii back to Los Angeles and hardly slept a wink. Ironically before we left home, I decided to leave my neck pillow at home. Why bring it - we were flying first class. Big mistake. United's definition of ""first class"" is no class. I regret wasting the points I took so long to collect on the United Airlines flights. I will never knowingly fly United again. Giving this a 2 only because the flight attendants were friendly and I felt sorry for them having to work for this airline.",Detractor
" Berlin to Frankfurt. The Boeing 747 is my favourite aircraft and Lufthansa flew that on this route. One thing I had to complain about (I guess that is more a Berlin TXL problem than LH) is that there were no open check-in counter in Terminal C where this flight departed. I guess it was because usually LH departs Terminal A but there was no space for the 747. There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far. The crew was very friendly, the entertainment program was good and they gave everyone a chocolate teddy after landing. The space between seats was good, I'm 1.67m and I could stretch my legs - I guess there were 10-15cm to the seat in front of me. All in all a very pleasant flight.",Promoter
" United Airlines at LAX literally the worst service I've ever received in my life and I have flown more than 3 dozen times. They forced me to check a small backpack for no reason other than I had a purse on me which they counted as another personal item. Many other people did this with much larger purses and carry on items. Complete and total garbage customer service at LAX. Will not fly United ever again even if it's cheaper, especially in Los Angeles.",Detractor
Bucharest-Amman return with Airbus 318 check-in on-line. Good flight with decent meal and beverages (including alcoholic beverages).

"Dublin to Frankfurt with Lufthansa in Business class. You get a great product and today everything was fine. Fast lane security, access to a nice and quiet Lounge in Dublin, priority boarding, a seat in a calm cabin with two armrests for your own and plenty of space for your elbows. Perfect food and drink servce and priority delivering of the bags. The price is not low-cost, but it is worth the product you get. Weak points? The seats do not really recline, there is no WiFi and there is no inflight entertainment, but as the flight takes only some 100 minutes, it is not a problem for me.",Promoter
LGW-KBP. Check-in staff friendly and efficient. Boarding slightly delayed so was departure. Cabin crew polite. Flew B737-500 which showed its age however it was very clean. Hot meal served onboard for 3 hr flight which was tasty and filling. Load 100% but didn't feel very cramped. Disembarking via stairs but I there are no air bridges in Borispol. Waiting for luggage was a pain at such a small airport (30 mins). Overall good experience but they could invest in new fleet.,Promoter
" Miami to San Francisco. Ridiculous! It's 1 am and still at the airport in Miami! My flight to San Francisco was supposed to depart at 7:50 pm and the crew had us waiting for 2 hours in the plane while fixing Documents. The problem is that they didn't keep us informed as to what was happening. Then we got sent to another aircraft because apparently the one we were originally didn't pass the test when it should've been tested beforehand. While we are waiting on the second flight after 4 hours of waiting then the crew disappears and we have not pilot. I completely understand that incidents happen if it's a weather condition, or even if there is something wrong with the aircraft. But, the fact that they staff kept lying to all passengers is not professional! My time is very valuable. Again very unprofessional from the company staff to not be transparent with the passengers.",Detractor

Flight from Germany to Charlotte NC to Huntsville AL in 05/2014 was the worst flight experience. TV screen did not work staff was not concerned after numerous requests. The aircraft had a malfunction before takeoff in NC delaying us 3 hours on the taxiway. This caused a missed flight at the connection stop. American did not care whatsoever and we had to ask to get a meal voucher but that was all that was given. They would only put us on another American flight that left hours later putting us home in the middle of the night and needed to be at work the next morning. Worst airline ever.

" Honolulu to Los Angeles. I attempted to check in online 18 hours prior to my flight. For whatever reason, the system processed mine but not my wife's. Since in the inbound flight we weren't seated together, I wanted to rectify this. I called AA and the first agent who answered immediately suggested it was my fault because I ""didn't check a box or something"". I suggested he first listen to me and run my record locator. All I wanted to do was ensure me. And my wife sat together this time. When he did, he said this is an issue with British Airways since they issued the ticket. I said that's impossible, because BA doesn't handle check in for flights on AA. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told to call BA or they could put me in touch with their website tech support (why?). Both the initial agent as well as the supervisor were incredibly rude and appeared to be doing whatever possible to get me off the line. I called BA. The agent, Dev, went above and beyond what could possibly be expected, and stayed with me for an hour to help. I explained what happened and he told me they're ""giving you the run around"" because, of course, BA doesn't handle check in for domestic AA flights. He offered to call AA for me and we were on a conference call. The supervisor he spoke to informed him that there was an issue with the passport info. He asked them to change the info and complete checkin and was told that was impossible. He said he knows for a fact it isn't, and it happens all the time. Since checkin wasn't my issue, but seating, he suggested my wife simply be given a seat next to me and she would complete checkin at the airport. The AA supervisor said that, too, was impossible. Until she's checked in, they can't assign a seat. Once again, the BA agent explained that this is impossible and he has lists of policies and regulations, not to mention previous experience. The AA supervisor hung up on him mid sentence. He apologized profusely and said he never experienced anything like this. We called again, and the agent we got this time was just as unhelpful and refused to do anything, but was at least pleasant. She suggested I pay to select my wife's seat, because next to me there is an empty one. The BA agent again asked why they can't assign it to her, it's within 24 hours of the flight. No. They won't assign it, they won't fix her checkin, but they're happy to SELL the seat. At this point in my frustration I said fine, I'll buy it. $50 additional fee if the agent takes my payment. Both me and the BA agent were at a loss for words. I ended up going online to buy the seat next to me for my wife, with Dev and the AA supervisor on hand to confirm it went through. AA succeeded in ruining my last day in Honolulu and wasting 2 hours of my time in order to squeeze even more money out of me. I would have thought that would be it, but upon arrival at Heathrow, I learned my bags didn't make the flight (2hr layover at LAX). This airline is an absolute joke, with complete disregard for passengers. Even the discount carriers treat you better. BA offered a black and white comparison between how an airline should behave and how it shouldn't. Dev was apologizing for things that weren't his fault, stayed with me until the end, whereas AA staff were aggressive and condescending, and even hung up on their British colleague. Absolutely shameful. The plane was also terrible, but west coast/Hawaii flights typically are. Shameful behavior.",Detractor

I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.,Promoter
"  China Southern from Los Angeles to Bangkok return via Guangzhou. The flight from LAX to CAN was 15 hours 10 minutes. On the way to Guangzhou I sat window seat, I was awake a good amount of the flight there and was comfortable. The seats were spacious, I had enough leg room and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was great and they are quick to bring you any beverage you need at any point in your stay. They had a huge selection of movies, a wide variety of shows available, music, short travel movies, the map was great, every seat had a charging station so that was great as well. On the flight home my friend asked for a snack after the last meal and they gave her a turkey sandwich. I also asked for a glass of wine and even though they were technically done with opening new bottles she found me some red wine and was able to pour us each a glass which helped go back to sleep for the rest of the flight. I'm extremely Lactose in tolerant and I was able to eat most of the meals. The layover in Guangzhou is what puts them over the top. I only speak English and didn't know a drop of Chinese. Upon exiting the plane the crew direct you where to go for your visa and a woman from China Southern who is fluent in English was waiting to help us, she made sure we filled out the paper work then gave us a map and went through the rest of the directions with us & ensured we understood completely what to do/where to go. My friend and I followed other people and got lost in the airport for 1-2 hours and once we found the paper she gave us we found our next stop within 5 minutes. Since we had a 26 hour layover the people at the China Southern counter had us pick a 5 star hotel. Since we were about to miss our bus the girls ran all the way through the airport with us, sat us on the first seats of the bus and talked to the bus driver and made sure he knew where to take us and made sure he told us when to get off. When our stop came up he found us and made sure we got off and told us where to go to find the concierge at the hotel. It was in the middle of the city and gorgeous. We got a great free buffet breakfast, transportation to and from the hotel. Everything free. The only things we paid for was our day of wandering around China before our flight to BKK.",Promoter

"Flew Ryanair for a business trip to Dublin. Chose Ryanair over airlines departing from Schiphol, because Eindhoven Airport is more convenient (small airport, with very fast check in/customs, boarding and luggage delivery - from landing to car in 20 mins). With Ryanair you know what to expect. Cramped seats and except for carry-on luggage, everything else will cost you. Value for money is good though, especially if you book in time and don't need to bring much luggage. Both flights were uneventful and arrived on time. The flight from Dublin to Eindhoven (Friday) was however boarded by a rather large group of semi-drunk Irish (wo)men who continued their drinking during the flight, had to use the toilets all the time and blocked the aisle. Headphones provided a welcome layer of isolation. For some reason, on the return flight there was more cabin luggage than could be fitted in the lockers. This was solved by putting whatever wouldn't fit on the floor of some free seats. Not sure if this is standard procedure, seemed a bit odd. Anyway, it was the standard Ryanair experience. If you don't mind the lack of comfort and service, it is perfectly fine for a couple of hours and good value for money.",Passive

On the international legs there were even announcements from the flight deck in English. Boarding as with all flights on Chinese carriers is a very quick and no nonsense affair.

"  Fargo to Boise via Minneapolis. Could have done more to compensate me after a four hour delay in Fargo due to a flat tire. Had to stay in Minneapolis and got to my hotel late. No meal voucher offered. All of my children and grandchildren traveled to visit me for my 65th Birthday. The celebration was delayed because of the flight delay. I asked you if I could get upgraded to first class the next day on my connecting flight due to all of the problems, missing my 65th Birthday celebration and I was told no.

I am a Vice President for a hotel company and had a guest presented these circumstances to one of my hotels, I would have treated that guest like royalty and given him the best room along with meals and even the next stay on us. Overall I am very upset. With all of the poor publicity that airlines are receiving for being apethetic towards their customers, I thought your company would have treated me with empathy and value my business.

" Let me start off by complimenting Air China for the good value for money service provided during my flights from Singapore to Beijing and Beijing to New York on 14th December. For the cheap fare I paid, the flying experience wasn't bad. However, the same cannot be said for my return flight from New York to Beijing on 7th January 2018 and Beijing to Singapore on 9th January 2018. My experiences were horrible. 1) I reached JFK Airport at 12.30 pm on 7th January to check in for my flight CA972, which was scheduled to depart at 3.50 pm. The check in process was messy and chaotic. There was no clear organized way and I was only able to check in a few minutes before the departure time. Quite a number of Passengers were still to be checked in after me and I believe that this was the reason the flight got delayed. 2) First, we were told that the flight got delayed for 2 hours. This was acceptable. We were also given 20 dollars worth of meal vouchers, which wasn't bad. Then, for no clear reason, our flight got delayed by almost 12 hours and we only took off at 4 am the next day. We were not given any further meal vouchers after the first one. The delay time was ridiculous. I would surely miss my connecting flight to Singapore. 3) The flight was actually pleasant and I reached Beijing at 8 am local time on the 9th January. The employees at the Air China Transfer Counter changed my ticket to Singapore on another flight 8 hours later. I was tired and asked if they would be offering any hotel. They did. However, instead of directing me to get a 1 day Visa in Beijing, they directed me to international transit. They told me that I would be able to find Air China employees there (inside the transit area) who would help me to with the hotel. All this time, I could hear them cursing in Chinese, muttering under their breath. I am not Chinese (South Asian), but understand the Chinese swear words from my stay in Singapore. When I confronted them about it, the became very rude and started avoiding me. Frustrated, I left for the transit area. Once I got in, I could not find any Air China personnel in the Transit area. I was stuck there tired with no hotel or food or lounge access. I could not go back out to confront those employees. The flight back to Singapore was pleasant. But they forgot to update my Kosher meal preference. I was too frustrated at that point to even respond. It had been 2 days on the road and I just wanted to come back home. So far this is my worst experience ever. I have nothing against the in-flight crews. They were very nice. But the Air China ground staff in Beijing were extremely rude and intentionally unhelpful. I was seduced by their low fares, but I will not be flying Air China ever again.",Detractor

I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea.

" My experience wasn't horrible as everyone says. I've not had a single issue. On my flight from BTS to STN at 6:30 in the morning everything was excellent with the airline. It was on time, staff were nice and friendly. The only issue I've had during the boarding process was because of Bratislava airport staff but that has nothing to do with Ryanair. I have one complaint but I do understand it. Checking in we got our seats seperated, but with the ticket price Ryanair sells, it's still cheap even after buying Selected seats. The food on board was cold, but when I asked the crew to heat it some more they kindly offered to do so. After landing the process was quick, but due to some issues at Stansted (which I learned happens often) we waited over an hour for our luggage. Having arrived soon in the morning and not having had any coach/train reservation for a specific time, this wasn't an issue for me. On my way back I would have things to complain about, but I'm not sure how much of it is Ryanair's fault. The airport was crowded, we waited a long time to depart or even board, apparently because checked in luggage hadn't arrived to the plane yet. We had out gate announced on time and having a 1 hour delay isn't too bad considering it's an evening flight by a budget company. The crew were again nice even though they had a whole day of work behind them. I wouldn't complain about the seats and comfort. Of course it wasn't perfect, but it wasn't uncomfortable and I would definitely fly Ryanair again. The value for money with this airline was perfect for me.",Passive

"Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure 11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.",Detractor
"  Guangzhou to Jakarta. I have been living and working in China for 3 years flying with China Southern every week. My wife is Chinese and she has always booked the flights (over 100) using her Chinese China Southern credit card. The trip from Guangzhou to Jakarta was no different, it was booked in plenty of time using the same method along with several other flights. A week before the flight while travelling elsewhere, I called at the China Southern counter to collect the receipts for the group of flights that had been booked, the Jakarta flight being one of them. A day before the flight I received a missed call from an unknown number. Upon my arrival at Guangzhou airport at 7am I was told that my ticket had been suspended. After a long and complex phone call from the customer services counter to the head office, I either needed to re-book it or get a photo of my wife, holding her Chinese ID and the credit card in front of her face to head office so that they would reinstate my ticket because the transaction had been identified as ""high risk"". Needless to say at 7.30am with 5 minutes until the flight closed this was not possible. I ended up having to buy another ticket, one for the original flight was 7000RMB more expensive than my original flight which cost 1370 RMB. The only option was to buy a ticket for the afternoon flight at 2000 RMB more than my original ticket and get put onto the morning flight. This is what I had to do. China Southern refunded me the cheaper original ticket but would not reimburse me for the extra 2000RMB it cost for the new ticket. They refused to reinstate my ticket despite them having the money, me having a receipt for it, a China Southern Credit card being used, other flights booked at the same time using the same method flown a few days earlier, me Elite loyalty card status and this booking method being used for the last 3 years on well over 100 flights. I wrote numerous emails and eventually ended up speaking to a customer service guy who said they could not refund the more expensive ticket because I had used it! Policy was policy. I asked to speak to his boss and he refused to give me his number or pass me across. To say I am disappointed in their customer service is an understatement, they could not care less about customers. They are happy to pocket the extra 2000RMB they made and just say rules is rules.",Detractor

AM633 on 21 August SAT-MEX and AM632 on August 25 MEX-SAT. Short trip from SAT to MEX and return on Embraer jet. First time on AM and it was a terrific experience crew were efficient aircraft clean and very well maintained. Snack service was tasty with fresh choices and excellent bar service. I will gladly take AM again as my travel plans permit.,Promoter
CX708 and CX709 17-19 Jan 2014. My friend and I booked our flight specifically with confirmation that we would have flown with the new business class seat on Boeing 747. Upon check in we were told that we were to fly on an Airbus 330. We boarded the plane and I was in shock. The seats were exactly the same as 10 years ago but older due to aging. The seats were old and ugly with a width of other '5-star' airlines premium economy class and recline of their economy! Lights were flickering during take off. My seat was broken and could not upright to 90 degrees for take off and landing. I was told at least 3 times by a steward to adjust my seat upright before he accepted the fact that my seat was broken. I was not offered another seat as the flight was fully booked. Personal TV screen was even smaller than my Samsung Galaxy phone with broken green and flickering display. When I tried to ask if there was power socket to charge my phone I was told that there wasn't one available! I tried to sleep but I could not because the seat was so uncomfortable with almost economy class recline. Instead of flying a bigger newer plane to replace reduced flight they decided to fly the oldest of the oldest. We were greeted with at least 5 idle Boeing 747 upon our arrival in Hong Kong. My flight back was the same plane type with the same discomfort but with a worse selection of food. The flight was not the cheapest but the most uncomfortable of all the choices I have.,Detractor
  We flew using Asiana Airline from Jakarta to Seoul Incheon. First impressions were nice and cabins were clean. Staff on board were extremely helpful and hospitality was top-notch,Promoter
  Luton to Budapest. I chose this airline because it was slightly cheaper than other cheap airlines but there was a big catch. When I was boarding I was told my carry on luggage is too big and they made me pay Â£40 to allow it in. That's Â£80 extra on a flight costing Â£200 which made the trip even more expensive than luxury airlines but will all the hassles of cheap airlines such as uncomfortable seats no tv system no food or drinks and very tight leg room. Annoyingly when I got onboard I saw that my luggage perefectly fitted under the seat so the whole thing was a sham. I had a feeling about it as I have travelled with this luggage for many years and never had a problem. I took a picture of my bag fit under the seat and I will be sending it to the airline asking for a refund but regardless of the outcome I will never use this airline again for causing me annoyance and ruining my holiday.,Detractor
 We flew from Frankfurt to Istanbul with Lufthansa. We wanted to find out how Europe's best airline is. Actually we awaited great services etc. But this was my last flight with Lufthansa. While we were waiting at the gate two policeman came and all the passengers had to go through this second security check to board the plane. Then the cabin crew was awful. After the boarding one of the flight attendants shouted at me because I was taking pictures of the planes outside. They had no motivation and were very chaotic. Additionally we had a 2h delay. It was a hot summer day and they wouldn't give us some water.,Detractor
I flew outbound with Ryanair and this was the return leg which I assumed would be far superior. SN has a superior hardware product and better facilities. However the crew let the trip down. Efficient but not friendly. The purser seemed to spend a lot if time scanning passengers and was even individually telling people off for not obeying the seatbelt sign long after the turbulence had passed. With crew it is luck and maybe they were having a bad day but for me this one experience has affected my image of the carrier.,Passive
" Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge Â£40 to pre reserve in Club and Â£70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.",Detractor
"  On 8/5/2017 I flew with Air Europa from Amsterdam with final destination Guayaquil. At Madrid airport we were delayed more than 5 hours because they hadn't arranged a plane for the scheduled flight. To begin with, there was no personnel responsible for informing us of the long delay. It was not enough that we were left waiting for about 5 hours without any official explanation from the company, but the personnel were incredibly rude with all the passengers. Instead of reassuring and calming us they were provocative and offensive against passengers.",Detractor
" I flew round trip with Cathay from New York to Bangkok with a layover in Hongkong which equates to 4 separate flights. In my opinion this airline is overrated. The one positive is the legroom is decent for economy. I'm 5'9"" and my boyfriend is 6'3"" and there was just enough space. However, the seat cushion was flimsy and did not have enough support. Customer service is subpar relative to other airlines I've flown on internationally i.e. Emirates, Eva Air, United. The food is barely edible. The flight attendants aren't as attentive. The plane seemed old, my audio for the TV wasn't working so they offered to move me to another seat but couldn't do the same for my boyfriend so we were separated. The seats were uncomfortable and the worst of all there is an odor from the bathroom that never subsides. Never again!",Detractor
"I broke my foot on my vacation and the entire flight staff were amazing. The cabin staff were very accommodating and helpful. They gave me the extra room I needed to elevate my foot, helped me walk to the bathroom every time I needed to use it and frequently checked on me to make sure I was okay - the pilot even checked on me to see how I was doing. I appreciate the kindness of the staff and would fly with Air Europa again.",Promoter

" Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. Charging to choose seats, even within 24h prior take off, is outrageous. So if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges?",Detractor
"Flown with Aeroflot for the first time, from Lyon to Yerevan return via Moscow. I was quite surprised to see that Aeroflot's fleet was very new. The interior of the airplanes (all A320) was very clean, and bright. Aeroflot respect their schedule, they even take off before scheduled time! Depending of the duration, they give you either a sandwich or a full meal. The sandwich bread is quite bad, but that's what you can expect in Economy. Otherwise, it's pretty correct. Crew is friendly. The seats are better than other similar airlines, they are leather-made. They give you pillows and blankets for night flights. There is no in-flight entertainment, which turns the flight quite boring, especially when it's long.",Passive
TLL-RIX-KPB economy. High overall price despite being advertised as low cost carrier. â‚¬190 for one way. Staff young and fresh but quite comfortable and fast few smiles could be added though. Legroom is good enough for a short flight. Delay in RIX for 30 min. Overall I would fly with them again. Food looks goods but prices seem to be outrage us.,Promoter
